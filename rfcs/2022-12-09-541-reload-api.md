# RFC 541 - 2022-12-09 - Reload API

This RFC proposes adding an HTTP API for Vector's configuration reloading
process. This will allow an enterprise control plane to more directly control a
running instance and provide a path for synchronous runtime feedback that
doesn't currently exist.

## Scope

### In scope

- Integrating an API that can initiate a reload and return success or failure
- Refactoring Vector's main application loop to better support such an API
- Allowing configuration error messages to be passed back via the API

### Out of scope

- Changing the actual reloading semantics of Vector in any way
- Implementing APIs for any other type of control actions

## Pain

Our enterprise control plane component needs to initate configuration reloads
in Vector and report back success or failure. Currently, the only way to do
that would be to manipulate the config files on disk, ensure Vector is watching
for changes, and parse the log output to determine whether or not the reload
succeeded. This would be difficult to implement and likely unreliable.

## Proposal

### User Experience

At startup, Vector will look for an environment variable
(`VECTOR_CONTROL_SOCKET_PATH`). If that variable is present and contains a
valid path, it will start an HTTP control server listening on a Unix socket at
that path.

The control server will support a single route at `POST /config`, which will
accept a JSON-encoded version of a Vector configuration. Similar to config
received from a provider implementation, input globs will be expanded but
environment variables will not be interpolated. The HTTP response will
synchronously indicate the success or failure of the triggered reload,
including any error messages scoped by component name.

### Implementation

The goal will be to implement a very simple, local-only API via which external
processes can hook directly into Vector's reloading process. An important
difference with existing solutions like providers is that the interaction will
be synchronous, i.e. there will be a response with either success or failure
and error messages for each reload attempt.

Currently, all of Vectors reloading ultimately happens in the main run loop,
where we watch for events like a signal, crash of a component, etc, and execute
the corresponding changes to the topology (slightly different depending on the
source of the signal). The first challenge will be to consolidate the logic of
what needs to happen when a config changes (e.g. updating GraphQL API state,
enterprise reporting, internal events, etc). A rough initial pass at that
process is included with the RFC PR to help show dependencies. The next step
would likely be to extract a `TopologyController` or similar struct that owns
the topology and everything that needs to change along with it. That struct can
then present a simple API for reloads that ensures everything is done in a
consistent matter, no matter the source.

Once that struct is in place, it can be wrapped in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>` or
similar such that it can be shared across both the existing `Signal`-focused
run loop and a new control server. The new control server itself can be a very
simple task spawned prior to entering the main loop. As a local-only control
API, it can different from most HTTP servers in a few ways:

- By listening on a Unix socket instead of the network, it can rely on
  filesystem permissions for authentication rather than its own scheme.
- Because it's designed for use with a single local client, it does not need to
  support concurrent processing of any kind. If it can't immediately acquire
  the lock on the `TopologyController`, it can fail and tell the client to try
  again.

With the server and controller in place, the path for synchronous feedback will
exist. The next step is to adjust the implementation of
`RunningTopology::reload_config_and_respawn` away from the current return value
of `Result<bool, ()>` and towards something that actually returns error
messages. This will involve a fair bit of work down into the reloading stack,
where we currently tend to emit errors as they happen. The likely solution will
be refactoring to build up an error report of some kind that can be reported
and/or returned at the end of the whole process.

## Rationale

This approach is designed to be relatively minimal while still achieving all of
the functionality needed for a good user experience. There are certainly deeper
changes that could (and should) be made around the design of this part of
Vector, and what we've set out here should be a good first step towards that
future while providing immediate user value. This design should also be
relatively easy to expand and evolve over time should be decide to adjust any
aspect of it.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback is the overlap in functionality with existing pieces of
Vector. These include:

- The GraphQL API: This is already "the API" and some confusion could result
  from introducing another (see alternatives section below for a discussion of
  why we're not reusing it).
- Providers: This is an existing path for configurable ways to provide
  configuration outside of the standard config file. Some but not all of the
  functionality here could be implemented as a provider.
- File-based configs: It could be confusing that this approach is not exclusive
  to the normal config loading/reloading processes being active. In theory,
  some strange interactions between the two are possible.

## Prior Art

- List prior art, the good and bad.
- Why can't we simply use or copy them?

## Alternatives

### Extend the GraphQL API

Instead of adding a new control-specific API, we could work with the existing
GraphQL API to add a mutation for updating the config. The main benefit to this
approach would be to maintain only a single API within Vector, which would
reduce the need for potentially duplicative configuration, documentation, etc.
There are also some potential future benefits to GraphQL if we later decided to
add some richer functionality to the API that would benefit from GraphQL's
specific capabilities.

The main reason this RFC does not take that approach is related to code
overhead and maintenance. While feature-rich, GraphQL is a relatively complex
technology that very few on the Vector team have any experience with. There is
a heavy reliance on proc macros for implementation of the server, and this
complexity carries over into the client as well. It has proven to be a
significant maintenance burden and it's unlikely that we want to continue
investing in it for Vector's use case. By starting a new, simpler API
foundation, we can set the stage to migrate current GraphQL API use cases
towards technology more suited to the team maintaining it.

### Make providers more synchronous

Likely the smallest change we could make would be to allow a feedback mechanism
for providers. This would allow us to implement the control server as a
provider with fewer structural changes to Vector's main run loop. Concretely,
this could look something like adding an optional oneshot response channel to
the `SignalTo::ReloadFromConfigBuilder` variant used by providers.

We don't take this route because the signal-based focus of reloading is already
overloaded enough to make the process difficult to follow. It's not a good
match for what we're trying to do and would like further obscure the logic,
making bugs more difficult to track down. In fact, given the limited uptake of
the provider system in general, it's possible that it should be reworked to fit
the same pattern as the new control server. This could be done as future work.

### More isolated control socket mode

Another option would be to branch earlier in `Application::run`, make options
related to the control server exclusive with normal options like `--config`,
and have more of a separate mode of operation for this functionality. This
would remove some concerns about potential strange interactions between
multiple paths for reloading (e.g. watching a file while running a control
server while running an HTTP provider) and potentially require less refactoring
work than what's proposed in this RFC.

This approach wasn't chosen because the divergence for "normal" Vector
operation would itself be a path for potentially confusing differences in
behavior. It also would not move us closer to an improved overall design for
this portion of Vector, and would create another path that we would later
likely want to unify.

## Outstanding Questions

- What is the expected flow for setting global options at startup (especially
  those that can't be changed via reload)? Use normal file loading with only
  global options set?
- Should the API accept entire configs, or should we attempt to limit to just
  sources/transforms/sinks?

## Plan Of Attack

- [ ] Extract controller struct to consolidate things that change with reloads
- [ ] Write simple Unix socket HTTP server task with `POST /config` route that builds/validates config
- [ ] Wrap and share controller struct with server task so it can actually do reloads
- [ ] Refactor topology reload method to return errors rather than log directly

## Future Improvements

- Write an RFC for differentiating different levels of configuration (e.g.
  global vs component, reloadable vs not) and modeling them better within
  Vector. Then use this to have a clearer distinction between what should be
  present in a global config file vs what's loadable via the API, make things
  appropriately exclusive and reduce the number of possible weird interactions
  from running multiple config loading mechanisms concurrently.
- Migrate features like `top` and `tap` to use the new API and reduce
  maintenance cost of old + new API.
- Improve the internal capabilities/modularity of reloads and expose that via
  the API, allowing for things like adding individual components rather than
  replacing current config wholesale, inspecting the current config, etc.
