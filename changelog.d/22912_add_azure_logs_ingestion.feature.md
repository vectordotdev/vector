Add support for the Azure Monitor Logs Ingestion API through a new `azure_logs_ingestion` sink.

The `azure_monitor_logs` sink is now deprecated, and current users will need to migrate to `azure_logs_ingestion` before Microsoft end support for the old Data Collector API (currently scheduled for September 2026).
