With this release, Vector has dropped official support for Ubuntu 16.04 because it depends on unsecure Node version. See
details [here](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-03-07-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node20-instead-of-node16-by-default/).
However, it is likely that Vector will continue to run on Ubuntu 16.04.
