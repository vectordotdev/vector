{title = "Kubernetes!", description = """\
We're doing this integration right. We've been alpha testing with a number of \
large clusters and we've honed in on a very high-quality approach that \
reflects the UX Vector is going after. You can learn more in our \
[Kubernetes Integration RFC][urls.pr_2222]. Feedback is welcome!\
"""},
{title = "WASM Driven Plugin Architecture", description = """\
This release included an overhaul of our [`lua` transform][docs.transforms.lua], \
which represents a big step towards making Vector more flexible. Lua is an \
excellent language when you need some quick scripting capabilities. But what \
if you need something more powerful? Like writing your own custom source, \
transform, or sink? Vector plans to solve this with [WASM][urls.wasm] foreign \
module support, enabling you to extend Vector in the language of your choice \
with little performance penalty. ❤️ WASM. Check out the \
[WASM Foreign Module Support RFC][urls.pr_2341] for more info.\
"""},
{title = "Dynamic HTTP Rate-Limiting (AIMD)", description = """\
Fiddling with rate-limits is a frustratin endaevor. If you set them too high \
you risk overwhelming the service; too low and you're unecessarily limiting \
throughput. And what happens if you deploy a few more Vector instances? \
Vector is planning to solve this by automatically detecting the optimal \
rate limits, taking inspiration from TCP congestional control algorithms. \
Check out the [Dynamic HTTP Rate Limiting RFC][urls.pr_2329].\
"""},
{title = "Vector Observability", description = """\
Did you know this release includes a new hidden `internal` source that emits \
metrics reflecting Vector's own internal state? 👀 We didn't highlight this \
source because we have not finished instrumenting Vector and we'll be \
changing the internal schema used.

Fun fact, we took an event-driven approach to Vector's internal observability, \
which we strongly beleive in. We want Vector to be a good example of our own \
advice. Checkout the [Event-Driven Observability RFC][urls.pr_2093].\
