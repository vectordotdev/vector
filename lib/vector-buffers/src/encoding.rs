/// An object that can encode and decode itself to and from a buffer.
///
/// # Metadata
///
/// While an encoding implementation is typically fixed i.e. `MyJsonEncoderType` only encodes and
/// decodes JSON, we want to provide the ability to change encodings and schemas over time without
/// fundamentally changing all of the code in the buffer implementations.
///
/// We provide the ability to express "metadata" about the encoding implementation such that any
/// relevant information can be included alongside the encoded object, and then passed back when
/// decoding is required.
///
/// ## Implementation
///
/// As designed, an implementor would define a primary encoding scheme, schema version, and so on,
/// that matched how an object would be encoded.  This is acquired from `get_metadata` by code that
/// depends on `Encodable` and will be stored alongside the encoded object.  When the encoded object
/// is later read back, and the caller wants to decode it, they would also read the metadata and do
/// two things: check that the metadata is still valid for this implementation by calling
/// `can_decode` and then pass it along to the `decode` call itself.
///
/// ## Verifying ability to decode
///
/// Calling `can_decode` first allows callers to check if the encoding implementation supports the
/// parameters used to encode the given object, which provides a means to allow for versioning,
/// schema evolution, and more.  Practically speaking, an implementation might bump the version of
/// its schema, but still support the old version for some time, and so `can_decode` might simply
/// check that the metadata represents the current version of the schema, or the last version, but
/// no other versions would be allowed.  When the old version of the schema was finally removed and
/// no longer supported, `can_decode` would no longer say it could decode any object whose metadata
/// referenced that old version.
///
/// The `can_decode` method is provided separately, instead of being lumped together in the `decode`
/// call, as a means to distinguish a lack of decoding support for a given metadata from a general
/// decoding failure.
///
/// ## Metadata-aware decoding
///
/// Likewise, the call to `decode` is given the metadata that was stored with the encoded object so
/// that it knows exactly what parameters were originally used and thus how it needs approach
/// decoding the object.
///
/// ## Metadata format and meaning
///
/// Ostensibly, the metadata would represent either some sort of numeric version identifier, or
/// could be used in a bitflags-style fashion, where each bit represents a particular piece of
/// information: encoding type, schema version, whether specific information is present in the
/// encoded object, and so on.
