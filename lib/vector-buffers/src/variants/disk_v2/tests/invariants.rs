    // The title is long and probably hard to grok, so here's a more straightforward explanation:
    //
    // When we initialize a buffer, if the writer previously left off on a partially-filled data
    // file, we load that data file and do a simple check to make sure the last record in the file
    // is valid.  If it's not valid, we consider that data file corrupted and skip to the next data
    // file.  This is intended to limit us writing records to a data file that the reader is going
    // skip the rest of when it detects a bad/corrupted record.
    //
    // The problem is that we might be skipping to a data file that we previously finished writing
    // to, but has not yet been fully processed (and thus deleted) by the reader.
    //
    // Assume our maximum data file count is 10, and the writer is on #9, and the reader is on #0.
    // We open data file #9 as the writer, and detect that it's not valid, so we want to skip to the
    // next data file, which is #0.  When we go to open that data file, we do detect that it already
    // exists, so we examine the size of the file.  That file could actually be less than the
    // maximum data file size: maybe we also skipped that one previously due to corruption and it
    // wasn't yet full.
    //
    // Thus, we are _only_ willing to open and use a partially-filled data file when it's the file
    // we left off on according to the ledger.  If we have to skip to the next data file, so be it,
    // but if it already exists, regardless of size, we need to wait for the reader to clear it out.
