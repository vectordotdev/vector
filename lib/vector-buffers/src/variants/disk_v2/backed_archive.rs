/// Backed wrapper for any type that implements [`Archive`][archive].
///
/// For any backing store that can provide references to an underlying byte slice of suitable size,
/// we can deserialize and serialize a type that is archivable. `BackedArchive` provides specific
/// entrypoints to either deserialize the given type from the backing store, or to serialize a
/// provided value to the backing store.
///
/// Once wrapped, the archived type can be accessed either immutably or mutably.  This provides a
/// simple mechanism to use a variety of backing stores, such as `Vec<u8>` or a memory-mapped
/// region.  This can in turn be used to avoid serializing to intermediate buffers when possible.
///
/// ## Archived types
///
/// Traditionally, (de)serialization frameworks focus on taking some type `T`, and translating it to
/// and from another format: structured text like JSON, or maybe binary data for efficient
/// on-the-wire representation, like Protocol Buffers.  `rkyv` works slightly differently, as a
/// zero-copy (de)serialization framework, by providing a projected type, or "archive", over the
/// underlying byte representation of `T`.
///
/// In general, what this means is that when you derive the correct traits for some type `T`, `rkyv`
/// generates an `ArchivedT` type that can correctly represent `T` when serialized to disk,
/// regardless of whether `T` contains primitive types or types holding underlying allocations, like
/// `Vec<T>`.
///
/// Crucially, the archive type -- `ArchivedT` -- can be pointer casted against the underlying bytes
/// to provide a reference of `ArchivedT`, or even a mutable reference.  This means that we can
/// access an object that is like our `T`, in a native and ergonomic way, without copying any bytes,
/// thus zero-copy deserialization.  Building off the ability to get a mutable reference, we can
/// also expose way to trivially update the underlying bytes through a safe interface, which can
/// avoid constantly serializing the entire type after changing a single field.
