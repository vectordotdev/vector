/// Delegated serialization.
///
/// This adapter type lets us delegate the work of serializing an `I` by delegating it to `H`, where
/// `H` represents some sort of helper type (a la `serde_with`) that takes `I` and serializes it in
/// a specific way. This is a common pattern for using standard Rust types on the interior (such as
/// `std::time::Duration`) but (de)serializing them in more friendly/ergonomic forms, like `10s`,
/// which requires the use of custom (de)serialize functions or types.
///
/// Concretely, in the codegen, if a value has no mitigating configuration, we treat it as if it is
/// already `Serialize`, and use it directly. Otherwise, if specific attributes are in place that
/// indicate the use of an optional helper type, we construct `Delegated<I, H>` where `H` is the
/// value passed to `#[serde(with = "...")]`.
///
/// Astute readers may realize: "but isn't the value of `with` supposed to be a module path where a
/// custom `serialize` and/or `deserialize` function exist?", and they would be correct insofar as
/// that is what the `serde` documentation states. However, that value is used to construct a _path_
/// to a function to be called, which means that if you simply specify a type that is in scope, and
/// it has a public function called `serialize` and/or `deserialize`, you end up with a path like
/// `MyCustomType::serialize`, which is valid, and `serde` and `serde_with` use this fact to support
/// generating custom types that can be used for (de)serialization.
///
/// This means we do some extra work up front to avoid misclassifying usages of `#[serde(with =
/// "...")]` that are using module paths, and as such, this also means that those usages are not
/// supported.
