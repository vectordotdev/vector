/// Embedding time as a type into other types eases property testing and verification. As such,
/// this trait represents the minimum functionality required to describe management of keyed timers
/// for the types implemented in this crate that require such behavior.

/// Users can look at `vector_stream::batcher::ExpirationQueue` for a concrete implementation.

    /// another key is added.

    ///
    /// The key of the subtimer is returned if it has expired, otherwise, returns `None` if the
    /// the queue is exhausted.

    /// Unlike a typical stream, returning `None` only indicates that the queue
    /// is empty, not that the queue will never return anything else in the future.
