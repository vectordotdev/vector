//! `Recency` deals with the concept of removing metrics that have not been updated for a certain
//! amount of time.  In some use cases, metrics are tied to specific labels which are short-lived,
//! such as labels referencing a date or a version of software.  When these labels change, exporters
//! may still be emitting those older metrics which are no longer relevant.  In many cases, a
//! long-lived application could continue tracking metrics such that the unique number of metrics
//! grows until a significant portion of memory is required to track them all, even if the majority
//! of them are no longer used.
//!
//! As metrics are typically backed by atomic storage, exporters don't see the individual changes to
//! a metric, and so need a way to measure if a metric has changed since the last time it was
//! observed.  This could potentially be achieved by observing the value directly, but metrics like
//! gauges can be updated in such a way that their value is the same between two observations even
//! though it had actually been changed in between.
//!
//! We solve for this by tracking the generation of a metric, which represents the number of times
//! it has been modified. In doing so, we can compare the generation of a metric between
//! observations, which only ever increases monotonically.  This provides a universal mechanism that
//! works for all metric types.
//!
//! `Recency` uses the generation of a metric, along with a measurement of time when a metric is
//! observed, to build a complete picture that allows deciding if a given metric has gone "idle" or
//! not, and thus whether it should actually be deleted.
