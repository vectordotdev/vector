# Deployment

![Example Topology Made Possible By Vector](../../assets/centralized-diagram.svg)

This section will cover deploying Vector. Vector is designed to deploy across your entire infrastructure, serving both as an [agent][docs.agent_role] and a [service][docs.service_role]. You combine these roles to form [topologies][docs.topologies], enabling Vector to serve the simplest and most complex use cases.

Start by becoming familiar with the possible [topologies][docs.topologies] and then take a closer look at the [roles][docs.roles] used to form these topologies.
