![Vector deployment diagram](/img/deployment.png)

This section covers deploying Vector. Because Vector is an end-to-end platform, you can deploy it under various [roles]. Vector is efficient enough to deploy as an [agent] and powerful enough to deploy as an [aggregator]. By combining these roles you can build robust and flexible topologies that fit into any infrastructure.

Start by becoming familiar with the [deployment roles][roles] and then take a closer look at example [topologies].
