Sources are responsible for ingesting [events][docs.event] into Vector, they can
both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector in an [agent
role][docs.agent_role], you'll want to look at local data sources like a
[`file`][docs.file_source] and [`stdin`][docs.stdin_source]. If you're deploying
Vector in a [service role][docs.service_role], you'll want to look at sources
that receive data over the network, like the [`vector`][docs.vector_source],
[`tcp`][docs.tcp_source], and [`syslog`][docs.syslog_source] sources.

| Name  | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| [**`file`**][docs.file_source] | Ingests data through one or more local files and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`journald`**][docs.journald_source] | Ingests data through log records from journald and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`kafka`**][docs.kafka_source] | Ingests data through Kafka 0.9 or later and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`statsd`**][docs.statsd_source] | Ingests data through the StatsD UDP protocol and outputs [`metric`][docs.metric_event] events. |
| [**`stdin`**][docs.stdin_source] | Ingests data through standard input (STDIN) and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`syslog`**][docs.syslog_source] | Ingests data through the Syslog 5424 protocol and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`tcp`**][docs.tcp_source] | Ingests data through the TCP protocol and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`udp`**][docs.udp_source] | Ingests data through the UDP protocol and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] events. |
| [**`vector`**][docs.vector_source] | Ingests data through another upstream Vector instance and outputs [`log`][docs.log_event] and [`metric`][docs.metric_event] events. |
