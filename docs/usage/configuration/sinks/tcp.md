# tcp sink

![][assets.tcp_sink]


The `tcp` sink [streams](#streaming) [`log`][docs.data-model.log] events to a TCP connection.

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (simple)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_sink_id]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = ["tcp", "The name of this component"] # must be: "tcp"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  address = "92.12.333.224:5000"
  
  # REQUIRED - requests
  encoding = ["json", "Each event is encoded into JSON and the payload is represented as a JSON array."] # enum: "json" or "text"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (advanced)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_sink_id]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = ["tcp", "The name of this component"] # must be: "tcp"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  address = "92.12.333.224:5000"
  
  # REQUIRED - requests
  encoding = ["json", "Each event is encoded into JSON and the payload is represented as a JSON array."] # enum: "json" or "text"
  
  # OPTIONAL - General
  healthcheck = true # default: true
  
  # OPTIONAL - Buffer
  [sinks.my_sink_id.buffer]
    type = ["memory", "Stores the sink's buffer in memory. This is more performant (~3x), but less durable. Data will be lost if Vector is restarted abruptly."] # default: "memory", enum: "memory" or "disk"
    max_size = 104900000 # no default, unit: bytes, relevant when type = "disk"
    num_items = 500 # default: 500, unit: events, relevant when type = "memory"
    when_full = ["block", "Applies back pressure when the buffer is full. This prevents data loss, but will cause data to pile up on the edge."] # default: "block", enum: "block" or "drop_newest"
  
  # OPTIONAL - Tls
  [sinks.my_sink_id.tls]
    ca_path = "/path/to/certificate_authority.crt" # no default
    crt_path = "/path/to/host_certificate.crt" # no default
    enabled = false # default: false
    key_pass = "PassWord1" # no default
    key_path = "/path/to/host_certificate.key" # no default
    verify_certificate = true # default: true
    verify_hostname = true # default: true
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

### address

`required` `type: string` `example: "92.12.333.224:5000"`

The TCP address.

### buffer

`optional`

Configures the sink specific buffer.

#### buffer.type

`optional` `default: "memory"` `type: string`

The buffer's type / location. `disk` buffers are persistent and will be retained between restarts.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"memory"` *(default)* | Stores the sink's buffer in memory. This is more performant (~3x), but less durable. Data will be lost if Vector is restarted abruptly. |
| `"disk"` | Stores the sink's buffer on disk. This is less performance (~3x),  but durable. Data will not be lost between restarts. |

#### buffer.when_full

`optional` `default: "block"` `type: string`

The behavior when the buffer becomes full.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"block"` *(default)* | Applies back pressure when the buffer is full. This prevents data loss, but will cause data to pile up on the edge. |
| `"drop_newest"` | Drops new data as it's received. This data is lost. This should be used when performance is the highest priority. |

#### buffer.max_size

`optional` `no default` `type: int` `unit: bytes` `example: 104900000`

The maximum size of the buffer on the disk. Only relevant when type = "disk".

#### buffer.num_items

`optional` `default: 500` `type: int` `unit: events`

The maximum number of [events][docs.event] allowed in the buffer. Only relevant when type = "memory".

### encoding

`required` `type: string`

The encoding format used to serialize the events before outputting.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"json"` | Each event is encoded into JSON and the payload is represented as a JSON array. |
| `"text"` | Each event is encoded into text via the `message` key and the payload is new line delimited. |

### healthcheck

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

Enables/disables the sink healthcheck upon start.

### tls

`optional`

Configures the TLS options for connections from this sink.

#### tls.enabled

`optional` `default: false` `type: bool`

Enable TLS during connections to the remote.

#### tls.ca_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/certificate_authority.crt"`

Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file, in DER or PEM format (X.509).

#### tls.crt_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/host_certificate.crt"`

Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (X.509) or PKCS#12. If this is set and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_path` must also be set.

#### tls.key_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/host_certificate.key"`

Absolute path to a certificate key file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (PKCS#8). If this is set, `crt_path` must also be set.

#### tls.key_pass

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "PassWord1"`

Pass phrase used to unlock the encrypted key file. This has no effect unless `key_pass` above is set.

#### tls.verify_certificate

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the TLS certificate of the remote host. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote certificate.

#### tls.verify_hostname

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the configured remote host name against the remote host's TLS certificate. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.

## How It Works

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a
[**best effort** delivery guarantee][docs.guarantees#best-effort-delivery].

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables]
section.

### Health Checks

Health checks ensure that the downstream service is accessible and ready to
accept data. This check is performed upon sink initialization.

If the health check fails an error will be logged and Vector will proceed to
start. If you'd like to exit immediately upon health check failure, you can
pass the `--require-healthy` flag:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

And finally, if you'd like to disable health checks entirely for this sink
you can set the `healthcheck` option to `false`.

### Streaming

The `tcp` sink streams data on a real-time
event-by-event basis. It does not batch data.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring#logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `tcp_sink` issues][urls.tcp_sink_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][urls.new_tcp_sink_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][urls.new_tcp_sink_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][urls.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.
