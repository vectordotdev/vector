# splunk_hec sink

![][assets.splunk_hec_sink]


The `splunk_hec` sink [batches](#buffers-and-batches) [`log`][docs.data-model.log] events to a [Splunk HTTP Event Collector][urls.splunk_hec].

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (simple)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_sink_id]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "splunk_hec" # must be: "splunk_hec"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

### batch_size

`optional` `default: 1049000` `type: int` `unit: bytes`

The maximum size of a batch before it is flushed.

### batch_timeout

`optional` `default: 1` `type: int` `unit: seconds`

The maximum age of a batch before it is flushed.

### buffer

`optional`

Configures the sink specific buffer.

#### buffer.type

`optional` `default: "memory"` `type: string`

The buffer's type / location. `disk` buffers are persistent and will be retained between restarts.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"memory"` *(default)* | Stores the sink's buffer in memory. This is more performant (~3x), but less durable. Data will be lost if Vector is restarted abruptly. |
| `"disk"` | Stores the sink's buffer on disk. This is less performance (~3x),  but durable. Data will not be lost between restarts. |

#### buffer.when_full

`optional` `default: "block"` `type: string`

The behavior when the buffer becomes full.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"block"` *(default)* | Applies back pressure when the buffer is full. This prevents data loss, but will cause data to pile up on the edge. |
| `"drop_newest"` | Drops new data as it's received. This data is lost. This should be used when performance is the highest priority. |

#### buffer.max_size

`optional` `no default` `type: int` `unit: bytes` `example: 104900000`

The maximum size of the buffer on the disk. Only relevant when type = "disk".

#### buffer.num_items

`optional` `default: 500` `type: int` `unit: events`

The maximum number of [events][docs.event] allowed in the buffer. Only relevant when type = "memory".

### encoding

`required` `type: string`

The encoding format used to serialize the events before outputting.

The field is an enumeration and only accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `"ndjson"` | Each event is encoded into JSON and the payload is new line delimited. |
| `"text"` | Each event is encoded into text via the `message` key and the payload is new line delimited. |

### healthcheck

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

Enables/disables the sink healthcheck upon start.

### host

`required` `type: string` `example: "my-splunk-host.com"`

Your Splunk HEC host.

### rate_limit_duration

`optional` `default: 1` `type: int` `unit: seconds`

The window used for the `request_rate_limit_num` option

### rate_limit_num

`optional` `default: 10` `type: int`

The maximum number of requests allowed within the `rate_limit_duration` window.

### request_in_flight_limit

`optional` `default: 10` `type: int`

The maximum number of in-flight requests allowed at any given time.

### request_timeout_secs

`optional` `default: 60` `type: int` `unit: seconds`

The maximum time a request can take before being aborted. It is highly recommended that you do not lower value below the service's internal timeout, as this could create orphaned requests, pile on retries, and result in deuplicate data downstream.

### retry_attempts

`optional` `default: 5` `type: int`

The maximum number of retries to make for failed requests.

### retry_backoff_secs

`optional` `default: 5` `type: int` `unit: seconds`

The amount of time to wait before attempting a failed request again.

### tls

`optional`

Configures the TLS options for connections from this sink.

#### tls.ca_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/certificate_authority.crt"`

Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file, in DER or PEM format (X.509).

#### tls.crt_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/host_certificate.crt"`

Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (X.509) or PKCS#12. If this is set and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_path` must also be set.

#### tls.key_path

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "/path/to/host_certificate.key"`

Absolute path to a certificate key file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (PKCS#8). If this is set, `crt_path` must also be set.

#### tls.key_pass

`optional` `no default` `type: string` `example: "PassWord1"`

Pass phrase used to unlock the encrypted key file. This has no effect unless `key_pass` above is set.

#### tls.verify_certificate

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the TLS certificate of the remote host. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote certificate.

#### tls.verify_hostname

`optional` `default: true` `type: bool`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the configured remote host name against the remote host's TLS certificate. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.

### token

`required` `type: string` `example: "A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C08"`

Your Splunk HEC token.

## How It Works

### Buffers & Batches

![][assets.sink-flow-serial]

The `splunk_hec` sink buffers & batches data as
shown in the diagram above. You'll notice that Vector treats these concepts
differently, instead of treating them as global concepts, Vector treats them
as sink specific concepts. This isolates sinks, ensuring services disruptions
are contained and [delivery guarantees][docs.guarantees] are honored.

*Batches* are flushed when 1 of 2 conditions are met:

1. The batch age meets or exceeds the configured `batch_timeout` (default: `1 seconds`).
2. The batch size meets or exceeds the configured `batch_size` (default: `1049000 bytes`).

*Buffers* are controlled via the [`buffer.*`](#buffer) options.

### Delivery Guarantee

This component offers an [**at least once** delivery guarantee][docs.guarantees#at-least-once-delivery]
if your [pipeline is configured to achieve this][docs.guarantees#at-least-once-delivery].

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables]
section.

### Health Checks

Health checks ensure that the downstream service is accessible and ready to
accept data. This check is performed upon sink initialization.

If the health check fails an error will be logged and Vector will proceed to
start. If you'd like to exit immediately upon health check failure, you can
pass the `--require-healthy` flag:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

And finally, if you'd like to disable health checks entirely for this sink
you can set the `healthcheck` option to `false`.

### Rate Limits

Vector offers a few levers to control the rate and volume of requests to the
downstream service. Start with the `rate_limit_duration` and `rate_limit_num`
options to ensure Vector does not exceed the specified number of requests in
the specified window. You can further control the pace at which this window is
saturated with the `request_in_flight_limit` option, which will guarantee no
more than the specified number of requests are in-flight at any given time.

Please note, Vector's defaults are carefully chosen and it should be rare that
you need to adjust these. If you found a good reason to do so please share it
with the Vector team by [opening an issie][urls.new_splunk_hec_sink_issue].

### Retry Policy

Vector will retry failed requests (status == `429`, >= `500`, and != `501`).
Other responses will _not_ be retried. You can control the number of retry
attempts and backoff rate with the `retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff_secs` options.

### Setup

In order to supply values for both the `host` and `token` options you must first
setup a Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Please refer to the [Splunk setup
docs][urls.splunk_hec_setup] for a guide on how to do this. Once you've setup
your Spunk HTTP Collectory you'll be provided a `host` and `token` that you
should supply to the `host` and `token` options.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring#logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `splunk_hec_sink` issues][urls.splunk_hec_sink_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][urls.new_splunk_hec_sink_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][urls.new_splunk_hec_sink_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][urls.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.
