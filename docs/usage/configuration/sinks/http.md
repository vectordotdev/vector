## I/O

The `http` sink batches events up to the `batch_size` or `batch_timeout` options. When flushed, Vector will write to a generic HTTP endpoint. The encoding is dictated by the `encoding` option. For example:

```http
POST <host>/_bulk HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
Content-Length: 654

{ "index" : { "_index" : "<index>" } }
{"timestamp": 1557932537, "message": "GET /roi/evolve/embrace/transparent", "host": "Stracke8362", "process_id": 914, "remote_addr": "30.163.82.140", "response_code": 504, "bytes": 29763} 
{ "index" : { "_index" : "<index>" } }
{"timestamp": 1557933548, "message": "PUT /value-added/b2b", "host": "Wiza2458", "process_id": 775, "remote_addr": "30.163.82.140", "response_code": 503, "bytes": 9468}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "<index>" } }
{"timestamp": 1557933742, "message": "DELETE /reinvent/interfaces", "host": "Herman3087", "process_id": 775, "remote_addr": "43.246.221.247", "response_code": 503, "bytes": 9700}
```



## How It Works

### Authentication

HTTP authentication is controlled via the `Authorization` header which you can set with the `headers` option. For convenience, Vector also supports the `basic_auth.username` and `basic_auth.password` options which handle setting the `Authorization` header for the [base access authentication scheme][basic_auth].

### Batching

By default, the `http` sink flushes every 5 seconds to ensure data is available quickly. This can be changed by adjusting the `batch_timeout` and `batch_size` options.

### Compression

The `http` sink compresses payloads before flushing. This helps to reduce the payload size, ultimately reducing bandwidth and cost. This is controlled via the `compression` option. Each compression type is described in more detail below:

| Compression | Description |
| `gzip` | The payload will be compressed in [Gzip][gzip] format before being sent. |

### Delivery Guarantee

This component offers an **at least once** delivery guarantee if your
[pipeline is configured to achieve this][at_least_once_delivery].

### Encodings

The `http` sink encodes events before flushing. This is controlled via the `encoding` option. Each encoding type is described in more detail below:

| Encoding | Description |
| `ndjson` | The payload will be encoded in new line delimited JSON payload, each line representing a JSON encoded event. |
| `text` | The payload will be encoded as new line delimited text, each line representing the value of the `"message"` key. |

### Health Checks

If the `healthcheck_uri` option is provided, Vector will issue a request to this URI to determine the service's health before initializing the sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][starting] Vector.

### Partitioning

In order to partition data within a Kafka topic, you must specify a `key_field`. This is the name of the field on your event to use as the value for the partition key. Partitioning data in Kafka is generally used to group and maintain order of data sharing the same partition key. You can learn more about partitioning in the [Kakfa docs][kafka_partitioning_docs].

You can use [transforms][transforms] to add a partition key field if your events do not already have one.

### Rate Limiting

Vector offers a few levers to control the rate and volume of requests. Start with the `rate_limit_duration` and `rate_limit_num` options to ensure Vector does not exceed the specified number of requests in the specified window. You can further control the pace at which this window is saturated with the `request_in_flight_limit` option, which will guarantee no more than the specified number of requests are in-flight at any given time.

Please note, Vector's defaults are carefully chosen and it should be rare that you need to adjust these.

### Retry Policy

Vector will retry failed requests (status == `429`, >= `500`, and != `501`). Other responses will not be retried. You can control the number of retry attempts and backoff rate with the `retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff_secs` options.

### Timeouts

The default `request_timeout_secs` option is based on the underlying timeout. It is highly recommended that you do not lower this below the service's timeout, as this could create orphaned requests and pile on retries.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sink%3A+http%22).
2. [Search the forum][search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][community] for help.
