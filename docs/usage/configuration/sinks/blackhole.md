# blackhole sink

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/blackhole-sink.svg)


The `blackhole` sink streams [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events to a blackhole that simply discards data, designed for testing and benchmarking purposes.

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (example)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_blackhole_sink]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "blackhole"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  print_amount = "1000"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (schema)" %}
```coffeescript
[sink.<sink-id>]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "<string>"
  inputs = "<string>"
  print_amount = <int>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (specification)" %}
```coffeescript
[sink.blackhole]
  # REQUIRED - General

  # The component type
  type = "blackhole"

  # A list of upstream source for more info.
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

  # The number of events that must be received in order to print a summary of activity.
  print_amount = "1000"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

| Key  | Type  | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---------- |
| `inputs` | `string` | A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][config_composition] for more info.<br />`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]` |
| `print_amount` | `int` | The number of events that must be received in order to print a summary of activity.<br />`required` `example: "1000"` |

## I/O

The `blackhole` sink streams events to a blackhole that simply discards data, designed for testing and benchmarking purposes. The encoding of each event is dictated by the `encoding` option. For example:

The `blackhole` sink streams events in a real-time fashion.



## How It Works

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a **best effort**
delivery guarantee.

### Health Checks

Vector will perform a simple health check against the underlying service before initializing this sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][starting] Vector.

### Performance

The `blackhole` source has been involved in the following performance tests:

* [`tcp_to_blackhole_performance`][tcp_to_blackhole_performance_test]

Learn more in the [Performance][performance] sections.

### Streaming

Events will be streamed in a real-time, one-by-one fashiong, making
events immediately available. They will not be batched.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sink%3A+blackhole%22).
2. [Search the forum][search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][community] for help.
