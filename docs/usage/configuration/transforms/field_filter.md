# field_filter transform

![][images.field_filter_transform]

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `field_filter` transform is in beta. Please see the current
[enhancements][url.field_filter_transform_enhancements] and
[bugs][url.field_filter_transform_bugs] for known issues.
We kindly ask that you [add any missing issues][url.new_field_filter_transform_issue]
as it will help shape the roadmap of this component.
{% endhint %}

The `field_filter` transform accepts [`log`][docs.log_event] and [`metric`][docs.metric_event] events and allows you to filter events by a log field's value.

## Config File

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (simple)" %}
```coffeescript
[transforms.my_transform_id]
  type = "field_filter" # must be: "field_filter"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  field = "file"
  value = "/var/log/nginx.log"

  # For a complete list of options see the "advanced" tab above.
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (advanced)" %}
```coffeescript
[transforms.field_filter_transform]
  # The component type
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  # * must be: "field_filter"
  type = "field_filter"

  # A list of upstream source or transform IDs. See Config Composition for more
  # info.
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

  # The target log field to compare against the `value`.
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  field = "file"

  # If the value of the specified `field` matches this value then the event will
  # be permitted, otherwise it is dropped.
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  value = "/var/log/nginx.log"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## How It Works

### Complex Comparisons

The `field_filter` transform is designed for simple equality filtering, it is
not designed for complex comparisons. There are plans to build a `filter`
transform that accepts more complex filtering.

We've opened [issue 479][url.issue_479] for more complex filtering.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration.environment-variables]
section.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `field_filter_transform` issues][url.field_filter_transform_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][url.new_field_filter_transform_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][url.new_field_filter_transform_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][url.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.


### Alternatives

Finally, consider the following alternatives:
