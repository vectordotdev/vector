# sampler transform

![][assets.sampler_transform]

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `sampler` transform is in beta. Please see the current
[enhancements][urls.sampler_transform_enhancements] and
[bugs][urls.sampler_transform_bugs] for known issues.
We kindly ask that you [add any missing issues][urls.new_sampler_transform_issue]
as it will help shape the roadmap of this component.
{% endhint %}

The `sampler` transform accepts [`log`][docs.data-model.log] events and allows you to sample events with a configurable rate.

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml" %}
```coffeescript
[transforms.my_transform_id]
  type = "sampler" # must be: "sampler"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  rate = 10
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

### inputs

`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]`

A list of upstream [source][docs.sources] or [transform][docs.transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][docs.configuration#composition] for more info.

### pass_list

`no default` `example: ["[error]", "field2"]`

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude events from sampling. If an event's `"message"` key matches _any_ of these patterns it will _not_ be sampled.

### rate

`required` `example: 10`

The rate at which events will be forwarded, expressed as 1/N. For example, `rate = 10` means 1 out of every 10 events will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped.

### type

`required` `must be: "sampler"`

The component type

## How It Works

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables]
section.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring#logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `sampler_transform` issues][urls.sampler_transform_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][urls.new_sampler_transform_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][urls.new_sampler_transform_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][urls.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.


### Alternatives

Finally, consider the following alternatives:

* [`lua` transform][docs.transforms.lua]
