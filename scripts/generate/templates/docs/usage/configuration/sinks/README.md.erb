Sinks are last in the [pipeline][docs.pipelines], responsible for sending
[events][docs.event] downstream. These can be service specific sinks, such as
[`vector`][docs.vector_sink], [`elasticsearch`][docs.elasticsearch_sink], and
[`s3`][docs.aws_s3_sink], or generic protocol sinks like
[`http`][docs.http_sink] or [`tcp`][docs.tcp_sink].
