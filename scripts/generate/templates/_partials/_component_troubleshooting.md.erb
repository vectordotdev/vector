The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues][url.<%= component.id %>_issues].
2. [Search the forum][url.search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][url.community] for help.
