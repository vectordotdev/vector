## Running

```bash
docker run timberio/vector:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-alpine
```

* The `vector` binary is located at `/usr/local/bin/vector`, which should be in your `$PATH`.
* The default [configuration file][docs.configuration] is located at `/etc/vector/vector.toml`.

## Configuring

The Vector Docker images ship with a [default `/etc/vector/vector.toml` configuration file][urls.default_configuration].
To use your own configuration file:

1. Create your own [Vector configuration file][docs.configuration] and save it
   as `vector.toml`.

2. Run the Vector Docker image with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run \
    -v $PWD/vector.toml:/etc/vector/vector.toml:ro \
    timberio/vector:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-alpine
   ```

   Modify `$PWD` to the directory where you store your local `vector.toml` file.

## Deploying

How you deploy Vector is largely dependent on your use case and environment.
Please see the [deployment section][docs.deployment] for more info on how to
deploy Vector.

## Updating

Simply run with newer version in the tag:

```bash
docker pull timberio/vector:X.X.X-alpine && \
  docker run timberio/vector:X.X.X-alpine
```

See the [variants](#variants) and [versions](#versions) sections to choose
the appropriate image for your use case.

## Images

### Variants

#### alpine

This image is based on the [`alpine` Docker image][urls.docker_alpine], which is
a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. It is considerably
smaller in size than other Docker images and statically links libraries. This
is the image we recommend due to it's small size and reliability.

```bash
docker run timberio/vector:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-alpine
```

#### debian

This image is based on the [`debian-slim` image][urls.docker_debian],
which is a smaller, more compact variant of the [`debian` image][urls.docker_debian].

```bash
docker run timberio/vector:<%= metadata.latest_version %>-debian
```
