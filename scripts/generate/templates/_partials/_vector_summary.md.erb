Vector is a lightweight, ultra-fast, [open-source][urls.vector_repo] tool for
building observability pipelines. Compared to Logstash and friends, Vector
[improves throughput by ~10X while significanly reducing CPU and memory
usage][urls.vector_performance].

### Principles

* **Reliability First.** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector's primary design goal is reliability.
* **One Tool. All Data.** - One simple tool gets your [logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric], and traces (coming soon) from A to B.
* **Single Responsibility.** - Vector is a _data router_, it does not plan to become a distributed processing framework.

### Who should use Vector?

* You _SHOULD_ use Vector to replace Logstash, Fluent*, Telegraf, Beats, or similar tools.
* You _SHOULD_ use Vector as a [daemon][docs.strategies#daemon] or [sidecar][docs.strategies#sidecar].
* You _SHOULD_ use Vector as a Kafka consumer/producer for observability data.
* You _SHOULD_ use Vector in resource constrained environments (such as devices).
* You _SHOULD NOT_ use Vector if you need an advanced distributed stream processing framework.
* You _SHOULD NOT_ use Vector to replace Kafka. Vector is designed to work with Kafka!
* You _SHOULD NOT_ use Vector for non-observability data such as analytics data.

### Community

* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector's largest user **processes over 10TB daily**.
* Vector is **used by multiple fortune 500 companies** with stringent production requirements.
* Vector has **over 15 active contributors** and growing.
