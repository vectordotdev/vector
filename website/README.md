# Website

This website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Automatically setup through Netlify. Commits to master will update the
production site and each branch will get a preview site as part of the Github
checks.
