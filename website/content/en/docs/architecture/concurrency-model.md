Vector implements a concurrency model that scales naturally with incoming data volume as shown above. Each Vector
[source][sources] is responsible for defining the unit of concurrency and implementing it accordingly. This allows for
a natural concurrency model that adapts to however Vector is being used, avoiding the need for tedious concurrency
tuning and configuration.

For example, the [`file` source][file] implements concurrency across the number of files it's tailing, and the [`socket`
source][socket] implements concurrency across the number active open connection it's maintaining.

## Stateless function transforms

As covered in the [pipeline model][pipeline] documentation, Vector's concurrency relies on stateless function transforms
that can be parallelized. Task transforms cannot be parallelized, currently, and so can introduce bottlenecks in
processing (we hope to improve this [in the future](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/11857)).
