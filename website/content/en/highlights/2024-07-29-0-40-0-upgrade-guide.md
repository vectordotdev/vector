Vector's 0.40.0 release includes three **breaking changes**:

1. [GELF codec defaults to null-delimited messages for stream-based sources](#gelf)
1. [Reduce transforms now properly aggregate nested fields](#reduce-aggregate)
1. [Vector no longer supports CentOS 7](#centos7)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Change

#### GELF codec defaults to null-delimited messages for stream-based sources {#gelf}

The GELF codec with stream-based sources now uses null byte (`\\0`) by default as messages delimiter
instead of newline (`\\n`) character. This better matches GELF server behavior.

##### Configuration changes

In order to maintain the previous behavior, you must set the `framing.method` option to the
`character_delimited` method and the `framing.character_delimited.delimiter` option to `\\n` when
using GELF codec with stream-based sources.

##### Example configuration change for socket source

###### Previous

```yaml
sources:
  my_source_id:
    type: "socket"
    address: "0.0.0.0:9000"
    mode: "tcp"
    decoding:
      codec: "gelf"
```

###### Current

```yaml
sources:
  my_source_id:
    type: "socket"
    address: "0.0.0.0:9000"
    mode: "tcp"
    decoding:
      codec: "gelf"
    framing:
      method: "character_delimited"
    character_delimited:
      delimiter: "\n"
```

#### Reduce transforms now properly aggregate nested fields {#reduce-aggregate}

Reduce transforms can now properly aggregate nested fields.

This is a breaking change because previously, merging object elements used the "discard" strategy.
The new behavior is to use the default strategy based on the element type.

##### Example

###### Config

```toml
group_by = [ "id" ]
merge_strategies.id = "discard"
merge_strategies."a.b[0]" = "array"
```

###### Event 1

```json
{
  "id": 777,
  "an_array": [
    {
      "inner": 1
    }
  ],
  "message": {
    "a": {
      "b": [1, 2],
      "num": 1
    }
  }
}
```

###### Event 2

```json
{
  "id": 777,
  "an_array": [
    {
      "inner": 2
    }
  ],
  "message": {
    "a": {
      "b": [3, 4],
      "num": 2
    }
  }
}
```

###### Reduced Event

Old behavior:

```json
{
  "id": 777,
  "an_array": [
    {
      "inner": 2
    }
  ],
  "message": {
    "a": {
      "b": [1, 2],
      "num": 1
    }
  }
}
```

New behavior:

```json
{
  "id": 777,
  "an_array": [
    {
      "inner": 1
    }
  ],
  "message": {
    "a": {
      "b": [
        [1, 2],
        [3,4]
      ],
      "num": 3
    }
  }
}
```

#### Vector no longer supports CentOS 7 {#centos7}

With this release, Vector has dropped support for CentOS 7 because CentOS 7 became EOL on June 30th,
2024.
