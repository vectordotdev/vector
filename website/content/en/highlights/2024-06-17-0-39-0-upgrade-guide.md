Vector's 0.39.0 release includes two **breaking changes**:

1. [Removal of the path coalescing operator](#path-coalescing)
1. [Removal of `enterprise` configuration](#enterprise-configuration)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Change

#### Path coalescing has been removed {#path-coalescing}

Coalescing of field lookup paths (e.g. `.(field1|field2)`) was deprecated and is now removed This
feature did not seem to be used much and significantly complicates parts of the codebase.

If you were using this feature, you can accomplish the same through conditionals in VRL like:

```vrl
field = if exists(.field1) {
  .field1
} else if exists(.field2) {
  .field2
}
```

#### Removal of `enterprise` configuration {#enterprise-configuration}

The deprecated `enterprise` global configuration option that was used to integrate Vector with the
Datadog Observability Pipelines product has been removed. Please reach out to Datadog support if you
are impacted by this to understand how to migrate.
