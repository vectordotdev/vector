Vector's 0.35.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components](#deprecate-file-tag)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks](#component-sent-bytes-total)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components {#deprecate-file-tag}

File-based components (file source, Kubernetes logs source, file sink) now include a
`internal_metrics.include_file_tag` config option that determines whether the `file` tag is included on the
component's corresponding internal metrics. This config option defaults to `true` for now to retain the
existing behavior. In the next release, the config option will be updated to default to `false`, as this
`tag` is likely to be of high cardinality.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks {#component-sent-bytes-total}

The AppSignal, Datadog Metrics, GreptimeDB, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Honeycomb, and HTTP sinks now correctly
report uncompressed bytes, rather than compressed bytes, for the `component_sent_bytes_total` internal metric.
