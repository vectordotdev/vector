## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components {#deprecate-file-tag}

File-based components (file source, Kubernetes logs source, file sink) now include a
`internal_metrics.include_file_tag` config option that determines whether the `file` tag is included on the 
component's corresponding internal metrics. This config option defaults to `true` for now to retain the 
existing behavior. In the next release, the config option will be updated to default to `false`, as this
`tag` is likely to be of high cardinality.
