Vector's 0.35.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [The Throttle transform's `events_discarded_total` internal metric is now opt-in](#events-discarded-total-opt-in)
1. [The `file` internal metric tag is now opt-in for file-based components](#file-tag-opt-in)
1. [Datadog sinks now default the API key and Site to the value of environment variables](#datadog-env-vars)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks](#component-sent-bytes-total)
1. [Update `component_received_bytes_total` to correctly report decompressed bytes for all sources](#component-received-bytes-total)
1. [Update default values for the `request.retry_max_duration_secs` and `request.rate_limit_num` sink configuration options](#request-config-options)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Changes

#### The Throttle transform's `events_discarded_total` internal metric is now opt-in {#events-discarded-total-opt-in}

The Throttle transform's `events_discarded_total` internal metric, which includes the `key` tag, is now only emitted on
an opt-in basis. Users can opt-in to emit this metric by setting `internal_metrics.emit_events_discarded_per_key` to `true`
in the corresponding Throttle transform component config. This change is motivated by the fact that the `key` metric tag has
potentially unbounded cardinality.

To view events discarded without the `key` tag, use the `component_discarded_events_total` internal metric.

#### The `file` internal metric tag is now opt-in for file-based components {#file-tag-opt-in}

File-based components (file source, Kubernetes logs source, file sink) now include a
`internal_metrics.include_file_tag` config option that determines whether the `file` tag is included on the
component's corresponding internal metrics. This config option defaults to `false`, as this `tag` is likely to
be of high cardinality.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks {#component-sent-bytes-total}

The AppSignal, Datadog Metrics, GreptimeDB, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Honeycomb, and HTTP sinks now correctly
report uncompressed bytes, rather than compressed bytes, for the `component_sent_bytes_total` internal metric.

#### Update `component_received_bytes_total` to correctly report decompressed bytes for all sources {#component-received-bytes-total}

The Heroku Logs, HTTP Server, Prometheus Remote Write, and Splunk HEC sources now correctly report decompressed bytes,
rather than compressed bytes, for the `component_received_bytes_total` internal metric.

#### Update default values for the `request.retry_max_duration_secs` and `request.rate_limit_num` sink configuration options {#request-config-options}

The `request.retry_max_duration_secs` config option previously defaulted to `3600` seconds. It now defaults to `30` seconds.

Also, a bug was fixed that prevented component-level default values from being applied. In particular, this updates the default value
for `request.rate_limit_num` for the following sinks:

| Sink                           | Default `request.rate_limit_num` Value | Previous Limit |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| AWS Cloudwatch Metrics Sink    | 150                                    | No limit       |
| Azure Blob Storage Sink        | 250                                    | No limit       |
| GCP Chronicle Unstructured Sink| 1000                                   | No limit       |
| GCP Cloud Storage Sink         | 1000                                   | No limit       |
| GCP Cloud Monitoring Sink      | 1000                                   | No limit       |

Note that all changes described above are reflected in the component reference documentation.

### [Datadog sinks now default the API key and Site to the value of environment variables](#datadog-env-vars) {#datadog-env-vars}

The Datadog Logs, Metrics, and Traces sinks now default the values of the [`default_api_key`][default_api_key] and [`site`][site]
configuration options to the values of environment variables `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_SITE`, respectively.
