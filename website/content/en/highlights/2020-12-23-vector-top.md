[`vector top`][top] is a command for the Vector [CLI] that displays both metrics emitted by your Vector instance as well
as information about your Vector [topology] through a beautiful dashboard-style interface reminiscent of tools like
[htop]. To use it, run `vector top` and specify the URL of the running Vector instance you want to monitor:

```bash
vector top --url https://my-vector-instance.prod.acmecorp.biz
```

That pulls up an interface that looks like this:

By default, the `vector top` looks for a Vector instance running locally at http://localhost:8686, but you can also
monitor remote instances, as in the example above. The information displayed updates every second by default, but you
can adjust that using the `--interval` flag.

Architecturally, `vector top` interacts directly with Vector's [GraphQL API][api], which was built with `vector top` as
a primary consumer. The dashboard UI was created using the excellent [tui-rs] library.
