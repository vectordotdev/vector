Vector's 0.44.0 release includes three **breaking changes**:

1. [Clickhouse Sink `skip_unknown_fields` changes](#clickhous-sink)
2. [File source `ignored_header_bytes` and `lines` fix](#file-source)
   We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:
3. [Some VRL functions are now fallible] (#vrl-breaking-changes)

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Change

#### Clickhouse Sink `skip_unknown_fields` changes {#clickhouse-sink}

The [skip_unknown_fields](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/clickhouse/#skip_unknown_fields) behavior was changed:

1. `skip_unknown_fields` is `true`: enables skipping unknown fields (overrides the server's default)
2. `skip_unknown_fields` is `false`: enables "strict" mode and does not allow skipping unknown fields for the request, (overrides the
   server's
   default)
3. `skip_unknown_fields` is not set: follows the server's default

Double-check your configuration and update the setting per above.

#### File source `ignored_header_bytes` and `lines` fix {##file-source}

When sourcing from compressed files, `ignored_header_bytes` will no longer look at the compressed file's bytes (which would include the
magic bytes for the compression header). Instead, it will ignore the bytes from the uncompressed content. Similarly, `lines` will no longer
look for new line delimiters in the compressed content, but the uncompressed content.

#### Some VRL functions are now fallible {#vrl-breaking-changes}

`to_unix_timestamp`, `to_float`, and `uuid_v7` can now return an error if the supplied timestamp is unrepresentable as a nanosecond
timestamp. Previously the function calls would panic. VRL scripts using the above functions will need to be updated to handle potential
errors.
