VRL version 0.22.0 included a couple of breaking Changes.

## The`truncate` no longer supports the `ellipsis` argument

The `ellipsis` argument was deprecated. You can use `suffix` instead. For example:

```javascript
truncate("A rather long sentence.", limit: 11, ellipsis: true)
```

becomes

```javascript
truncate("A rather long sentence.", limit: 11, suffix: "...")
```


## The `slice` VRL function preserves more type information on array elements

The `slice` function now preserves more type information on array elements. This might change the
fallibility of functions used in your VRL programs. For example, see the following program:

```text
arr = [3.5, "str"]
sub = slice!(arr, 0, 1)
first = sub[0]

# pre v0.22.0
#. = to_int!(first)

# Now,the compiler knows that `first` is an float, and we don't need the `!`.
. = to_int(first)
```
