## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Change to set expiration behavior in `prometheus_exporter` sink {#prom-exporter-set-expiration}

As part of work to better control memory growth in the `prometheus_exporter` sink, we've done some
work to ensure that metric expiration behavior is consistent for all metrics.  Instead of reporting
a count of zero when they expire, sets will now stop reporting entirely when they expire and are
flushed.

Due to how the `prometheus_exporter` sink works, Vector must store a snapshot of the state of all
metrics: the latest value of a counter or a gauge, and so on.  Sets represent a list of unique
values, and these values can be anything from integer to strings, which over time, can grow quite
large.  To combatg memory growth, we "expire" metrics from the sink if they have not been updated
within the time window configured by `flush_period_secs`.

For all metrics besides sets, we would delete the metric from the internal state and stop reporting
it.  For sets, however, we would simply clear their values and thus report a set size of zero.  This
behavior was not consistent with how we expired other metric types, and additionally, could still
lead to a growth of unique series in a scrape, over time, as we would clear the set but not stop
reporting it.

#### New metrics behavior for `route` transform {#metrics-route-transform}

Previously, a `route` transform was internally expanded into a separate
transform for each defined route. Each of these expanded transforms then
emitted its own metrics. Now, with improved internal support for components with
multiple outputs, this expansion mechanism has been removed.

A single `route` transform will now emit one set of metrics. For the following
metrics, specific route information will be recorded as a metric tag `output`.

- `component_sent_events_total`
- `component_sent_event_bytes_total`
- `events_discarded_total`

For example, for a `route` transform `foo` with a route `first` configured,
the `events_discarded_total` metric will now look like the following:

```diff
- {"counter":{"value":10.0},"name":"events_discarded_total"... "tags":{"component_id":"foo.first","component_kind":"transform","component_name":"foo.first","component_type":"route"}}
+ {"counter":{"value":10.0},"name":"events_discarded_total"... "tags":{"component_id":"foo","component_kind":"transform","component_name":"foo","component_type":"route","output":"first"}}
```

#### New internal events for `loki` sink {#events-loki-sink}

The `loki` sink can be configured to either drop or rewrite the timestamp of events that are
out-of-order. With this release we've updated the logs and metrics related to both options for
`out_of_order_action`.

`drop`:

- Associated log now emitted at DEBUG, rather than WARN
- `processing_errors_total` metric deprecated, will be removed next release
`events_discarded_total` metric
- `component_discarded_events_total` added to align the sink with new component spec

`rewrite_timestamp`:

- Associated log now emitted at DEBUG, rather than WARN
- `processing_errors_total` metric deprecated, will be removed next release
- `rewritten_timestamp_events_total` metric added

### Deprecations

#### Version 1 of the Vector protocol has been deprecated {#deprecate-v1}

With this release, we've deprecated version 1 of the Vector protocol used by the
`vector` sink to write data to a remote `vector` source. The `vector` source and
sink now default the `version` field to `"2"` (in 0.19.0 the default of "v1" was
removed). Support for version 1 of the protocol will be removed in a future
release.

See the [announcement post][vector-v2-announcement] for additional details
about why we introduced this new gRPC-based protocol.
