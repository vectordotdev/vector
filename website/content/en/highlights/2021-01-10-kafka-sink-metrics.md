The [`kafka` sink][kafka_sink] now supports metrics, making it possible to send
metric events through Kafka. Metrics events are encoded into a format that
mimics our [internal metrics data model], ideal for custom consumers on the
other end. Getting started is easy:

```toml
[sources.host_metrics]
type = "host_metrics"

[sinks.kafka]
type = "kafka"
inputs = ["host_metrics"]
encoding.codec = "json"
```

## Caveats

We currently do not support ingesting metric events in the `kafka` source. This
is due to the hesitation to introduce yet another metrics format into the world.
Instead, we are working to support an open metrics format that the `kafka`
source and sink will support. See [issue 5809] for more info.
