Vector's 0.26.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [Removal of `check_fields` condition type](#check-fields-removal)
2. [Removal of `lanes` parameter for `route` transform](#lanes-parameter-route-transform-removal)
3. [Removal of `geoip` transform](#geo-transform-removal)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of `check_fields` condition type {#check-fields-removal}

Nearly two years ago, as part of the [0.12.0 release](https://vector.dev/highlights/2021-02-16-0-12-upgrade-guide/#fourth),
we had deprecated many transforms and conditions after initially releasing
[Vector Remap Language](https://vector.dev/blog/vector-remap-language/). Over time, many of these
transforms and conditions were fully removed, but some of them were left as the performance gap
between them and their equivalent usage in VRL had significant performance differences.

Since then, many of these performance gaps have been significantly reduced, if not closed entirely.
After taking another look at `check_fields`, it now has less than a 10% performance difference
compared to the equivalent VRL, which we feel is close enough to allow us to finally remove support
for `check_fields`.

As we don't always have a full view into what features of Vector are being used, please do not
hesitate to let us know if the removal of `check_fields`, and having to switch over to using VRL,
represents a significant performance regression for you.

#### Removal of `lanes` parameter for `route` transform {#lanes-parameter-route-transform-removal}

Similarly to the removal of `check_fields`, the `lanes` parameter of the `route` transform is a
holdover from when the transform was originally called `swimlanes`. It is an alias to the `route`
parameter used to configure the actual routing logic for the transform. We deprecated being able to
reference the `route` transform by its former name of `swimlanes` in the 0.24.0 release, and removed
the ability entirely in 0.25.0.

In following with removing the `swimlanes` alias, we're now removing the `lanes` alias as well to
finally drop all remaining ties to the original `swimlanes` name.

A simple change of the field name in your configuration is all that has to change:

```yaml
transforms:
  my_route:
    type: route
    lanes: # <-- change this to "route"
      route_a: ..
```

#### Removal of `geoip` transform {#geo-transform-removal}

The `geoip` transform was deprecated in `0.24.0` and has now been removed. You can
get the same functionality through a `remap` transform with [`geoip` enrichment
tables](/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#enrichment_tables.type). These can be used
with [VRL's enrichment table functions](/docs/reference/vrl/functions/#enrichment-functions) to
enrich events using a [GeoIP database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases).

For example,

```yaml
transforms:
  geoip:
    type: geoip
    inputs:
      - with_ip_info
    database: /etc/vector/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
    source: ip_address
    target: geoip
```

can be migrated as:

```yaml
enrichment_tables:
  geoip_table:
    path: /etc/vector/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
    type: geoip

transforms:
  geoip:
    type: remap
    inputs:
      - with_ip_info
    source: |-
      .geoip = get_enrichment_table_record!("geoip_table",
        {
          "ip": .ip_address
        }
      )
```
