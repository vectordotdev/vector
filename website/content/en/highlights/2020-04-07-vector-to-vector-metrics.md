Until recently the [`vector` source][docs.sources.vector] only accepted
[`log` events][docs.data-model.log]. Supporting metrics was blocked by pending
metric data model development, as well as topology improvements.
[PR#2245][urls.pr_2245] removes that limitation enabling you to truly build
observability pipelines that can process both logs and metrics, such as
the [centralized topology][docs.topologies#centralized].
