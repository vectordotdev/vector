## Upgrade guide

### Removal of deprecated configuration fields for the Splunk HEC Logs sink: `host` {#splunk-hec-logs-sink-deprecated-fields}

We've removed a long deprecated configuration field from the Splunk HEC Logs
sink: `host`.

You can migrate your configuration by switching to `endpoint` instead.

```diff
 [sinks.splunk]
   type = "splunk_hec_logs"
-  host = "http://splunk-endpoint"
+  endpoint = "http://splunk-endpoint"
   ...
```

### Updated internal metrics for the Splunk HEC sinks {#splunk-hec-sinks-metrics-update}

As part of moving towards more consistent Vector component instrumentation,
we've updated the following internal metrics in the Splunk HEC sinks. For any
removed metric, we've added an equivalent alternative.

- Removed `encode_errors_total`
  - Instead, use `component_errors_total` with the tag `error_type = encode_failed`.
- Removed `processing_errors_total` with tag `error_type = invalid_metric_kind`
  - Instead, use `component_errors_total` with the tag `error_type = invalid_metric`.
- Removed `processed_bytes_total`
  - Instead, use `component_received_event_bytes_total` and `component_sent_event_bytes_total`.
- Added `components_discarded_events_total`
  - Previously, no metric was emitted when an encoding error occurred and an
    event was dropped.

### Removal of deprecated configuration fields for the Elasticsearch sink (#elasticsearch-sink-deprecated-fields)

| `host`             | `endpoint`            |
| `bulk_action`      | `bulk.action`         |
