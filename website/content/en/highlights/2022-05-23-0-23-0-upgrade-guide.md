Vector's 0.23.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [The `.deb` package no longer enables and starts the Vector systemd service](#systemd-autostart)
2. [VRL type definition updates](#vrl-type-def)
3. ["remove_empty" option dropped from VRL's `parse_grok` and `parse_groks`](#vrl-parse_grok)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### [The `.deb` package no longer enables and starts the Vector systemd service] {#systemd-autostart}

The [official `.deb` package](https://vector.dev/download/)
no longer automatically enables and starts the Vector systemd service.
This is in line with how the RPM package behaves.

To enable and start the service (after configuring it to your requirements),
you can use `systemctl enable --now`:

```shell
systemctl enable --now vector
```

To just start the service without enabling it to run at system startup,

```shell
systemctl start vector
```

#### [VRL type definition updates] {#vrl-type-def}

There were a couple situations where VRL didn't calculate the correct type
definition. These are now fixed. In some cases this can cause compilation
errors when upgrading if the code relied on the previous behavior.

This affects the following:

- the "merge" operator (`|` or `|=`) on objects that share keys with different types
- if statements

#### ["remove_empty" option dropped from VRL's `parse_grok` and `parse_groks`] {#vrl-parse_grok}

The "remove_empty" argument has been dropped from both the `parse_grok` and the
`parse_groks` functions. Previously, these functions would return empty strings
for non-matching pattern names, but now they are not returned. To preserve the
old behavior, you can do something like the following to merge in empty strings
for each unmatched group:

```coffee
parsed = parse_grok!(.message, "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:level} %{GREEDYDATA:message}")
expected = { "timestamp": "", "level": "", "message": ""}
parsed = merge(expected, parsed)
```
