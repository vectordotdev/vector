## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Behavior of the `datadog_logs` sink's `endpoint` setting {#datadog-logs-endpoint}

The `endpoint` configuration setting is common to each of the Datadog sinks. Before this
change, when `endpoint` was set, the logs sink took the provided endpoint as the complete
URL (including API path) to use for posting HTTP requests. This behavior is inconsistent
with the other Datadog sinks, which use the `endpoint` as a base URL that the API path
(eg. "/api/v2/logs"), is appended to.

With this release, the `datadog_logs` sink's behavior is now consistent with the other
Datadog sinks for the `endpoint` setting.

#### Disable OpenSSL legacy provider by default {#openssl-legacy-provider}

Vector upgraded the version of OpenSSL that it statically compiles in to v3.1.x in the 0.32.0 release.
Following our deprecation policy, v0.33.0 now disables the legacy OpenSSL provider by default. It can be
enabled via an [OpenSSL configuration file](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man5/config.html). The file
location defaults to `/usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf` or can be specified with the `OPENSSL_CONF` environment variable.


### Deprecations

#### Default config location change {#default-config-location-change}

The default config location `/etc/vector/vector.toml` which is used by Vector `0.32.0` is now deprecated. This location will still be used in `0.33.0`. The new default path is `/etc/vector/vector.yaml`, please migrate to this new default path or specify the config path explicitly.

Vector `0.33.0` will attempt to load `/etc/vector/vector.toml` first, and if it is not present, it will fallback to `/etc/vector/vector.yaml`. However, Vector release `0.34.0` will automatically load `/etc/vector/vector.yaml` only.


#### Renaming the `armv7` rpm package {#armv7-rename}

The `armv7` rpm package, `vector-<version>-1.armv7.rpm`, is now published as
`vector-<version>-1.armv7hl.rpm` to better follow rpm guidelines. The `armv7`
package will be no longer be published beginning in the 0.34.0 release.

#### Metadata field in the Vector protobuf definition {#vector-proto-metadata}

This release adds a new `Metadata` proto Message which is appended to the end of the
`Metric` message of the Vector proto. Prior to this release, the existing `metadata`
field contained only a single field from Vector's `EventMetadata` structure. The
newly added field (`event_metadata`) represents a structure that can contain any
field added that needs to be included from `EventMetadata`.

In order to preserve backwards comatability, the existing `metadata` field is available
to use as-is, but is noted as deprecated.

In a future release, this field index (19) will be fully unsupported and marked as a
`reserved` field in the proto definition. Any users setting the Value `metadata` field
at index 19 should change to populate the `event_metadata.value` instead.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Async runtime default number of worker threads {#runtime-worker-threads}

We've changed the default number of worker threads spawned by Vector's async runtime
from being the number of CPUs on the host machine to the value returned by
[`std::thread::available_parallelism()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.available_parallelism.html).
This should be a better default value for containerized environments where the container
has limited quotas, but note this change may impact performance.

The number of worker threads used can be seen by enabling debug logging, and the value can
be overriden by setting the `VECTOR_THREADS` environment variable.

#### Setting `request.concurrency = "none"` {#request-concurrency}

Explicitly setting `request.concurrency = "none"` in a sink configuration now properly configures
the sink to have a fixed concurrency limit of 1, as was stated in the documentation. Previously, the
above configuration would result in the sink using adaptive request concurrency. The default setting
remains to be adaptive request concurrency.
