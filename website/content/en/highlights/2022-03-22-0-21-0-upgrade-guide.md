## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Syntax changes for non-VRL paths {#path-syntax-changes}

Previously, there were two different ways to describe paths. VRL uses a newer syntax, while everything
else in Vector still used an older syntax. This was a constant pain point for users,
and we have taken some steps to migrate towards the VRL syntax. This is a **breaking change** that may require migration.

The old syntax was very lenient in the characters that were allowed in a field name. It also supported single character escapes.
The new syntax only allows `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ @`. Any other character will require the field name to be quoted.
Quotes around a field name replace single character escaping. This brings the old syntax in line with the newer (VRL) syntax. Note that
VRL makes a distinction between a field starting with a "." (event query) and without (variable query). Outside a VRL context,
the "." is optional and ignored.

Migration will be required for any paths used outside a VRL context. That is any transform (except remap and conditions), templating,
and any source or sink referencing field names. There are _no_ changes to the VRL syntax.

Here are some examples that require migrating

| old syntax | new syntax | comment |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| foo\\.bar.baz     | "foo.bar".baz     | The `.` field separator needs to be escaped if used as part of a field name. The old syntax allowed individual character escaping. The new syntax requires quotes around the field name.
| headers.User-Agent | headers."User-Agent" | `-` requires quotes with the new syntax
| foo with spaces | "foo with spaces" | Spaces also need to be quoted
| foo\\"bar | "foo\\"bar" | Double quotes and backlashes must be escaped _inside_ quotes


### TOML transform example

Old syntax

```toml
[transforms.dedupe]
type = "dedupe"
inputs = ["input"]
fields.match = ["message.user-identifier"]
```

New syntax (the dash requires the field name to be quoted)

```toml
[transforms.dedupe]
type = "dedupe"
inputs = ["input"]
fields.match = ["message.\"user-identifier\""]
```

For more information on the new syntax, you can review the documentation [here](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/expressions/#path)



#### GraphQL API `outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns` subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns` {#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns}

To avoid confusion and align with the new `inputsPatterns` argument, we've
renamed the original `patterns` argument to `outputsPatterns`. `outputsPatterns`
allows you to specify patterns that will match against components (sources,
transforms) and display their _outflowing_ events. `inputsPatterns` allows you
to specify patterns that match against components (transforms, sinks) and
display their _incoming_ events.

Note that using an input pattern to match a component is effectively a
shorthand. It's the same as using one or more output patterns to match against
all the outputs flowing into a component.

Updating your subscriptions is as simple as renaming `patterns` to
`outputsPatterns`.

```diff
- subscription {
-  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...])
+ subscription {
+  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...])
```

#### GraphQL API `EventNotification` type changes {#api-event-notification-changes}

As part of adding a new notification (`InvalidMatch`) to warn users against
attempting invalid matches, we've reshaped the `EventNotification` type for
easier querying and future extensibility.

Previously, the `EventNotification` type consisted simply of a `pattern` and
plain enum describing the notification.

```graphql
type EventNotification {
  pattern: String!
  notification: EventNotificationType!
}
```

While this worked well for simple notifications like `Matched` and `NotMatched`,
it was awkward to extend to new notifications, like `InvalidMatch`, which may
want to include more information than `pattern`. Thus, the new
`EventNotification` type takes the following form:

```graphql
type EventNotification {
  notification: Notification!
  message: String!
}
```

where `Notification` is a union of specific kinds of notifications:

```graphql
union Notification = Matched | NotMatched | InvalidMatch
```

`message` is a new human-readable description of the notification while
`notification` contains additional details specific to the kind of notification.
All the same information is still available, and the following example shows how
you might convert an existing query to the new schema.

```diff
 subscription {
-   outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...]) {
+   outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...]) {
     __typename
     ... on EventNotification {
-       pattern
-       notification
+       message
+       notification {
+         __typename
+         ... on Matched {
+           pattern
+         }
+         ... on NotMatched {
+           pattern
+         }
+         ... on InvalidMatch {
+           pattern
+           invalidMatches
+         }
+       }
      }
     }
   }
 }
```

#### Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed {#removed-deprecated-subscriptions}

The following deprecated subscriptions have been removed in this release. Please
use the listed alternatives.

- `eventsInTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `eventsOutTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsInThroughputs`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsInTotals`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsOutThroughputs`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsOutTotals`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `eventsInThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `eventsOutThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`

#### The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z` {#vector-vrl-timezone}

We upgraded the Vector CLI to use [Clap v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a
popular Rust crate.

A breaking change in Clap v3 is that shortened CLI flags now use the `char`
type, meaning they are restricted to single characters.

As a consequence, the shortened form of our `vector vrl --timezone` flag
(previously `--tz`) has been updated to the more succinct `-z`.

#### The `vector top` human_metrics short flag `-h` is now `-H` {#vector-top-human-metrics}

To avoid clashing and issues with our upgrade to [Clap
v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), the short `-h` from `--help` and `-h` from
`--human_metrics` in the `vector top` command have been disambiguated. The
shortened form for `--human_metrics` is now `-H` and `-h` is reserved for
`--help`.

#### Remainder operator (%) in VRL is fallible {#remainder-fallible}

The remainder operator in VRL has become a fallible operation. This is because
finding the remainder with a divisor of zero can raise an error that needs to
be handled.

Before this VRL would compile:

```coffee
.remainder = 50 % .value
```

If `.value` was zero, Vector would panic. This can be fixed by handling the error:

```coffee
.remainder = 50 % .value ?? 0
```

#### AWS SDK Migration {#aws-sdk-migration}

We have migrated sources and sinks that utilize AWS to the official AWS SDK (from Rusoto).
This comes with some benefits such as support for IMDSv2. This requires us to deprecate some config options.

The new AWS SDK lacks support for certain authentication configuration:

- Vector now only supports IMDSv2 for authentication. If you were previously using IMDSv1, you will need to configure
  the host to allow IMDSv2. For EKS, this likely means increasing the metadata token response hop limit to 2 (see
  [Amazon EKS now supports EC2 Instance Metadata Service v2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-eks-supports-ec2-instance-metadata-service-v2/).
  We are
  discussing the possibility of re-adding support for IMDSv1 in
  [#12376](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/12376).
- Vector AWS components' `auth.credential_file` option was removed as the new [SDK does not yet support it
  it](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/237). It is still possible to use a credentials file, but it should
  be placed in the default location (`~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, OS X, and Unix; `%userprofile%\.aws\credentials` on
  Microsoft Windows), or the location should be set with an environment variable (`AWS_CONFIG_FILE` or
  `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`).
- Support for `credential_process` in an AWS profile was dropped as it is [not yet supported by the new
  SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/261).

Specifying a region is now also required. Make sure a region is specified in either the AWS config file, or the Vector config.

The `assume_role` config option was deprecated and moved to `auth.assume_role` previously. This deprecated option has
now been removed.

This affects the following components:

- AWS Cloudwatch Metrics Sink
- AWS Cloudwatch Logs Sink
- AWS SQS Source (this was migrated in a previous version)
- AWS SQS Sink
- AWS Kinesis Streams Sink
- AWS Kinesis Firehose Sink
- AWS S3 Sink
- AWS S3 Source
- Datadog Archives Sink (s3 config only)
- Elasticsearch Sink

For more details on configuring auth, you can visit these links:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/credentials.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/environment-variables.html

#### Route transform metric `event_discarded_total` removed {#transform-route-metric}

Until now, when using the `route` transform, if an event didn't match any configured route, this event would be
discarded and lost for the following transforms and sinks.

A new `_unmatched` route has now been introduced and the events are no longer discarded, making the `event_discarded_total` metric irrelevant so it has been dropped.

You can still get the total number of events that match no routes via `component_events_sent_total` with a tag of `output=_unmatched`.

#### `buffer_discarded_events_total` now includes received events {#buffer-discarded-events}

The `buffer_discarded_events_total` now includes all events flowing into
a buffer, even those discarded when the buffer is full and `drop_newest` is
configured as the `when_full` behavior.

This brings the metric inline with the component-level received and discarded
metrics where events are counted as received before being discarded as well as leaving
the door open for additional discard strategies like `drop_oldest` where events
would live in the buffer before possibly being discarded.

#### `kubernetes_logs` source rewritten to use `kube-rs` {#kubernetes-logs}

The `kubernetes_logs` source has had two breaking changes:

- It now requires the `list` verb for Vector's ClusterRole resource. If you
are using the Helm chart, version `0.7.0` includes this change. Otherwise,
make sure to add it to your manifest.
- The `proxy` configuration was dropped. Instead, configure any needed proxy
configuration in your `kubeconfig`.

See the [highlight](/highlights/2022-03-28-kube-for-kubernetes_logs) for more information.

#### Published docker images no longer create implicit volumes {#docker-volume}

Previously `/var/lib/vector` was defined as a volume in the `Dockerfile`s for
the published Vector images. This led to the creation of the volume each time
you ran a Vector container from these images whether you wanted it or not.

Instead, if you need a volume for the data directory, you should provide one
when launching the container.

When migrating from an earlier version to 0.21.0 or later using Docker compose
and implicit volumes, you need to use docker inspect to find out which volumes
your container is mapped to so that you can map them to the upgraded container
as well.

See
[vectordotdev/vector#11982](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/11982)
for additional rationale.

#### VRL now includes lexical scoping for blocks {#vrl-lexical-scoping}

In preparation for **VRL iteration support** landing in the next release, this
release of Vector includes a breaking change to the way _variable scoping_
works.

Specifically, variables _defined_ in nested blocks cannot be accessed by parent
blocks.

This is best explained with an example:

```coffee
# top-level scope
count1 = 1

# nested block
{
  count2 = 1
  count1 = count1 + 1

  # nested block
  {
    count2 = count2 + 1
    count1 = count1 + 1
  }
}

count1 # returns ”3”
count2 # returns a compile-time error, because ”count2” was defined in a nested block
```

#### CLI options: delimiters, wildcards, and boolean options {#cli-option-changes}

When using CLI options that can take multiple values, the provided values must
be comma separated. For example:

```shell
vector --config foo.toml,bar.toml
```

Additionally when passing values that contain wildcards (`*`), these values
must be quoted. For example:

```shell
vector --config "*.toml"
```

The `--watch-config` option previously required a boolean value, which is no
longer needed. For example, in earlier releases:

```shell
vector --watch-config=true
```

This should become:

```shell
vector --watch-config
```

### Iteration Sneak Preview

The introduction of lexical scoping is important for when iteration support
lands, which (as a sneak preview) allows you to do the following:

```coffee
data = { ”foo”: 1, ”bar”: 2 }

map(data) -> |key, value| {
  new_key = upcase(key)

  [new_key, value + 1]
}

data # returns { ”FOO”: 2, ”BAR”: 3 }

new_key # returns a compile-time error, because ”new_key” is a variable scoped
        # to the enumeration closure block
```

Without lexical scoping, it would be ambiguous what `new_key` should return in
the last example, but now it’s clear that the variable remains undefined outside
of the closure block.

### Deprecations

#### The GraphQL API subscriptions: `receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` have been deprecated {#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions}

While these subscriptions were intended to display aggregate metrics across all
components, they currently only show a per-component metric and are made
redundant by more informative subscriptions that include specific component
information. To avoid misuse and confusion, we are deprecating them in favor of
the following alternatives.

- `receivedEventsTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `receivedEventsThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`

#### End-to-end acknowledgement configuration moved to sinks {#sink-acks}

Currently, end-to-end acknowledgements are opt-in at the source-level
via the `acknowledgements.enabled` setting. This made sense initially
since sources are the ones that are acknowledging back to clients, but
makes it difficult to achieve durability. Durability, which is the
primary goal of acknowledgements, is sink-dependent instead of
source-dependent. That is, it is important to assert that all data
going to a system of record is fully acknowledged, for example, for
all the sources that it came from, this guaranteeing delivery to that
destination.

To achieve this, an `acknowledgements` option has been added to
sinks. When the configuration is loaded, all sources that are
connected to a sink that has this option enabled will automatically be
configured to wait for sinks to acknowledge before issuing their own
acknowledgements (where possible).

The source configuration `acknowledgements` option will remain in this
version, but is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

See [the documentation for end-to-end acknowledgements][acknowledgements] for
more details on the acknowledgement process.
