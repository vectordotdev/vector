This guide assumes you understand [basic Vector concepts][concepts]

[concepts]: /docs/about/concepts
{{< /requirement >}}

Vector provides CLI [subcommands][subcommands] to perform various tasks apart from running pipelines. This short guide focuses on how to
use the `generate-schema` subcommand to generate the Vector schema with your Vector binary and how to provide its output to an IDE to
enable autocompletion.

## How to use `generate-schema`

Run the following:

```sh
# Optional step: get the Vector version and include it in the file name.
# vector --version
vector generate-schema -o vector-v0.45.0-schema.json
```

## Integrate with IDEs

### JetBrains (e.g. RustRover)

1. `Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Schemas and DTDs | JSON Schema Mappings`
2. Import `vector-v0.45.0-schema.json`

You can find more details [here][jetbrains].

### Visual Studio Code

Follow the guide [here][vscode].

## Example

With this setup, the IDE will provide real-time suggestions and reduce visits to the [Vector docs][docs].
