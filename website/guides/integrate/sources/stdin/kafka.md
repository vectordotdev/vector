Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [STDIN][urls.stdin] to [Kafka][urls.kafka]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is Kafka?

[Apache Kafka][urls.kafka] is an open source project for a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system rethought as a distributed commit log. Kafka stores messages in topics that are partitioned and replicated across multiple brokers in a cluster. Producers send messages to topics from which consumers read. This makes it an excellent candidate for durably storing logs and metrics data.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[sidecar][docs.strategies#sidecar].

The [sidecar deployment strategy][docs.strategies#sidecar] is designed to
collect data from a _single_ service. Vector has a tight 1 to 1 coupling with
each service. Typically data is collected by tailing local files via Vector's
[`file` source][docs.sources.file], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

  sinkName={"kafka"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <li>
    Accept new line delimited log data through STDIN.
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically enrich logs with host-level context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to Kafka.
    <ul>
      <li>Leverage any of AWS' IAM strategies.</li>
      <li>Optionally compress data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

Or choose your [preferred method][docs.installation].

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path={"vector.toml"}
  sourceName={"stdin"}
  sinkName={"kafka"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
