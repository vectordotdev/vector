Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [HTTP][urls.http] to [AWS S3][urls.aws_s3]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is AWS S3?

[Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)][urls.aws_s3] is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and applications on Amazon Web Services. It is very commonly used to store log data.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies#service].

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies#service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is designed to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations.
For this guide, Vector will receive data from
HTTP via Vector's
[`http` source][docs.sources.http].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<ServiceDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"http"}
  sinkName={"aws_s3"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <li>
    Accept log data over HTTP.
    <ul>
      <li>Decode JSON, NDJSON, and text.</li>
      <li>Enrich your logs with select HTTP headers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to AWS S3.
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamically partition logs across different key prefixes.</li>
      <li>Compress and batch data to reduce storage cost and imrpove throughput.</li>
      <li>Optionally adjust ACL and encryption settings.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path={"vector.toml"}
  sourceName={"http"}
  sinkName={"aws_s3"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
