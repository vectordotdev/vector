Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analying them can
be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve the
basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it in
a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from HTTP to Elasticsearch
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ol className="list--checks list--semi-bold list--flush">
  <li>
    Accept log data over HTTP.
    <ol>
      <li>Decode JSON, NDJSON, and text.</li>
      <li>Enrich your logs with select HTTP headers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to Elasticsearch (AWS, Elastic Cloud, self-hosted, etc).
    <ol>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Dynamically partition logs across indexes.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ol>

## How It Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars], lightweight, and
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] utility for building observability
pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it memory safe and
reliable. We'll be deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies.service].

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies.service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations.
For this guide, Vector will receive data from
HTTP via Vector's
[`` source][docs.sources.http].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

  sourceName={"http"}
  sinkName={"elasticsearch"} />

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"http"}
  sinkName={"elasticsearch"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
