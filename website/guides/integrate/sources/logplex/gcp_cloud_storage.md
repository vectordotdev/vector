Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from Heroku Logplex to GCP Cloud Storage (GCS)
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ol className="list--checks list--flush">
  <li>
    Accept Heroku Logplex data over HTTP.
    <ol>
      <li>Automatically parse incoming data into structured events.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to GCP Cloud Storage.
    <ol>
      <li>Leverage any of GCP's IAM strategies.</li>
      <li>Confifgure object sizes to reduce request cost.</li>
      <li>Dynamically partition logs across different key prefixes.</li>
      <li>Optionally compress data to reduce storage cost.</li>
      <li>Control object-level ACL.</li>
      <li>Choose different storage classes for cost control.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ol>

## How It Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars], lightweight, and
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] utility for building observability
pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it memory safe and
reliable. We'll be deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies#service].

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies#service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations.
For this guide, Vector will receive data from
Heroku Logplex via Vector's
[`` source][docs.sources.logplex].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<ServiceDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"logplex"}
  sinkName={"gcp_cloud_storage"} />

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"logplex"}
  sinkName={"gcp_cloud_storage"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
