Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [a file][urls.file] to [a Splunk HEC][urls.splunk_hec]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is Splunk HEC?

The [Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC)][urls.splunk_hec] is a fast and efficient way to send data to Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Notably, HEC enables you to send data over HTTP (or HTTPS) directly to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud from your application.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[daemon][docs.strategies#daemon].

The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies#daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host.
For this guide, Vector will collect data from
a file via Vector's
[`file`][docs.sources.file].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<DaemonDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"file"}
  sinkName={"splunk_hec"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <li>
    Tail one or more files.
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically discover new files with glob patterns.</li>
      <li>Merge multi-line logs into one event.</li>
      <li>Checkpoint your position to ensure data is not lost between restarts.</li>
      <li>Enrich your logs with useful file and host-level context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to a Splunk HTTP event collector.
    <ul>
      <li>Customize which fields should be added to the Splunk index.</li>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

Or choose your [preferred method][docs.installation].

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path={"vector.toml"}
  sourceName={"file"}
  sinkName={"splunk_hec"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
