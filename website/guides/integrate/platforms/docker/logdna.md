Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [Docker][urls.docker] to [LogDNA][urls.logdna]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is Docker?

[Docker][urls.docker] is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running
applications and services. Docker enables you to separate your services from your infrastructure so you can ship quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your services. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### What is LogDNA?

[LogDNA][urls.logdna] is a log management system that allows engineering and DevOps to aggregate all system, server, and application logs into one platform. Collect, monitor, store, tail, and search application logs in with one command-line or web interface.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[daemon][docs.strategies#daemon].

The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies#daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host.
For this guide, Vector will collect data from
Docker via Vector's
[`docker`][docs.sources.docker].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

  sourceName={"docker"}
  sinkName={"logdna"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <li>
    Collect Docker container logs.
    <ul>
      <li>Filter which containers you collect them from.</li>
      <li>Automatically merge logs that Docker splits.</li>
      <li>Enrich your logs with useful Docker context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to the LogDNA logging service.
    <ul>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path={"/etc/vector/vector.toml"}
  sourceName={"docker"}
  sinkName={"logdna"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start the Vector container

```bash
docker run \
  -v $PWD/vector.toml:/etc/vector/vector.toml:ro \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  timberio/vector:latest-alpine
```

<CodeExplanation>

* The `-v $PWD/vector.to...` flag passes your custom configuration to Vector.
* The `-v /var/run/docke...` flag ensures that Vector has access to the Docker API.
* The `timberio/vector:latest-alpine` is the default image we've chosen, you are welcome to use [other image variants][docs.platforms.docker#variants].

</CodeExplanation>

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
