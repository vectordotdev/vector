Vector is only as good as it's documentation and education. And while we
put effort into our [docs][pages.docs], we felt there was an educational
aspect missing, so we launched a new [new guides section][pages.guides]. This
section is meant to house high-quality guides that will be maintained and
updated continuously. To kick this new section off we've added the following:

<Jump to="/guides/getting-started/" iconLeft="book">Getting Started Series</Jump>
<Jump to="/guides/advanced/custom-aggregations-with-lua/" leftIcon="book-open">Custom Aggregations With Lua</Jump>
<Jump to="/guides/advanced/parsing-csv-logs-with-lua/" leftIcon="book-open">Parsing CSV Logs With Lua</Jump>
<Jump to="/guides/advanced/parsing-csv-logs-with-lua/" leftIcon="book-open">Unit Testing Your Configs</Jump>
