This section will cover deploying Vector. Vector is designed to be the single
and only tool needed to get data from A to B, serving both as an
[agent][docs.roles.agent] and a [service][docs.roles.service]. You combine
these roles to form [topologies][docs.topologies].

Start by becoming familiar with the [roles][docs.roles] and then take a closer
look at the [topologies][docs.roles] you can create.
