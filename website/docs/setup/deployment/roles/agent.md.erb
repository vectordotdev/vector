When Vector serves as an agent, its purpose is to efficiently and quietly
collect data. In this scenario, Vector is typically sharing a host with a more
important service. Therefore, it is critically important that Vector is a good
citizen, limiting its resource usage and efficiently forwarding data.

## Vector Configuration

### Collecting Data

#### In a platform context

If you're deploying Vector in a [platform context][docs.platforms], such as
[Docker][docs.platforms.docker], then data collection is handled for you as
part of installation, please proceed to the next section.

#### Not in a platform context

If you are not deploying Vector in a platform context, then data collection
must be achieved through more generic means, such as [journald][urls.journald],
a [file][docs.sources.file], or [stdin][docs.sources.stdin]. The method you use
depends on your setup. In general, we recommend avoiding stdin unless reducing
disk usage is top priority. Stdin is limiting, in that it is coupled with a
single input stream, meaning you cannot restart Vector independently, and you
cannot accept data from multiple streams at the same time. This makes it more
difficult to manage.

### Sending Data

#### Forwarding to a downstream Vector service

If you're forwarding data to a downstream [Vector service][docs.roles.service],
then you should use the [`vector` sink][docs.sinks.vector]. The downstream
Vector service should use the [`vector` source][docs.sources.vector]. This
handles communication between Vector instances.

#### Not forwarding to a downstream Vector service

If you are not forwarding data to a downstream Vector service then you can
choose [any sink you'd like][docs.sinks], but be cognizant of how many sinks
you're using, as more sinks usually means more resource usage. If you find
that Vector is hogging resources, then you should provision additional
resources, or consider a [centralized][docs.topologies#centralized] or
[stream-based][docs.topologies#stream-based] topology to push resource usage
downstream.

#### Hybrid forwarding

There is nothing that prevents you from sending data to both a downstream
Vector service and another independent service. Often times this makes the
most sense if the downstream service is designed for streaming, as it takes
load off of the downstream Vector service. For example, you might want to take
advantage of [Big Query's streaming inserts][urls.big_query_streaming]. This
feature is designed for rapid streaming and it has the added benefit of making
data quickly available for querying. To implement this, you can forgo using a
centralized Vector service entirely and stream data directly from your client
nodes.

## System Configuration

### Limiting Resources

Vector is designed to be [_highly_ efficient][pages.index#performance], but this does
not preclude Vector from consuming an excess amount of resources in certain
scenarios. This is not ideal as an agent where priority should be given to the
primary service on the host. Therefore, it is recommended to limit Vector
resource usage. We strongly believe resource limiting should be achieved at
higher levels, and depending on your platform this can be achieved through a
variety of means. For example:

* [Limiting resources with Systemd][urls.systemd_limit_resources]
* [Limiting resources with cgroups][urls.cgroups_limit_resources]
* [Limiting resources with Kubernetes][urls.kubernetes_limit_resources]

If none of the above links are relevant, please refer to your platform's
documentation on limiting resources.

#### Resource limit recommendations

In general, we recommend the following _minimum_ limitations:

* At least 5% CPU
* At least 256mb of memory

A good resource manager will allow Vector to use more CPU and memory when
available. You should not have to provide any additional limitations.

## Administration

### Configuration Changes

Vector can be [reloaded][docs.process-management#reloading] to apply configuration changes.
This is the recommended strategy and should be used instead of restarting
whenever possible.

### Updating Vector

To [update][docs.updating] Vector you'll need to restart the process. This
is why we recommend using sources that use the disk as a buffer, as it decouples
the Vector process from the source process. This allows other processes to
continue running while Vector restarts. When Vector is restarted, it can resume
where it left off.
