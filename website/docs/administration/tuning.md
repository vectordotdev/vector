## Maximizing Resources

Vector is written in [Rust][urls.rust] and therefore does not include a runtime
or VM. There are no special service level steps you need to do to improve
performance. By default, Vector will take full advantage of all system
resources.

## Limiting Resources

Conversely, when deploying Vector in the [agent role][docs.roles.agent] you'll
typically want to limit resources:
