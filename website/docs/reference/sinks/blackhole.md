The Vector `blackhole` sink
[streams](#streaming) [`log`][docs.data-model.log] and
[`metric`][docs.data-model.metric] events to a blackhole that simply discards
data, designed for testing and benchmarking purposes.

activity.

## How It Works

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the
[Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables] section.

### Health Checks

Health checks ensure that the downstream service is accessible and ready to
accept data. This check is performed upon sink initialization.
If the health check fails an error will be logged and Vector will proceed to
start.

#### Require Health Checks

If you'd like to exit immediately upon a health check failure, you can
pass the `--require-healthy` flag:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

#### Disable Health Checks

If you'd like to disable health checks for this sink you can set the
`healthcheck` option to `false`.

### Streaming

The `blackhole` sink streams data on a real-time
event-by-event basis. It does not batch data.
