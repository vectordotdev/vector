### cache_size_per_tag

The size of the cache in bytes to use to detect duplicate tags. The bigger the
cache the less likely it is to have a 'false positive' or a case where we allow
a new value for tag even after we have reached the configured limits.

## Examples

This example will demonstrate how metric tags are dropped if they exceed the
configured [`value_limit`](#value_limit).

For example, given this configuration:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[transforms.cardinality_protection]
  type = "tag_cardinality_limit"
  inputs = [...]

  fields.value_limit = 1
  fields.limit_exceeded_action = "drop_tag"
```

Vector will drop metric tags that exceed a cardinality of 1. Note, this limit is
unrealistically low and used only for demontration purposes.

If we were to receive the first metric event:

```js
{
  "name": "login.count",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:47+00:00",
  "kind": "absolute",
  "tags": {
    "host": "my.host.com",
    "request_id": "f9ed4675f1c53513c61a3b3b4e25b4c0"
  },
  "counter": {
    "value": 10
  }
}
```

It would pass through like normal; no tags would be removed. But if we were to
recieve a second metric event:

```js
{
  "name": "login.count",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:48+00:00",
  "kind": "absolute",
  "tags": {
    "host": "my.host.com",
    "request_id": "30f14c6c1fc85cba12bfd093aa8f90e3"
  },
  "counter": {
    "value": 4
  }
}
```

The `request_id` tag would be removed:

```js
{
  "name": "login.count",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:48+00:00",
  "kind": "absolute",
  "tags": {
    "host": "my.host.com"
  },
  "counter": {
    "value": 4
  }
}
```

This is because the cardinality is 2 for this metric tag, exceeding the
configured limit of 1. Note that the `host` tag was _not_ removed, because
it still has a cardinality of 1.

If you'd like to drop the entire event, just set [`limit_exceeded_action`](#limit_exceeded_action) to
`"drop_event"`.

## How It Works

### Complex Processing

If you encounter limitations with the `tag_cardinality_limit`
transform then we recommend using a [runtime transform][urls.vector_programmable_transforms].
These transforms are designed for complex processing and give you the power of
full programming runtime.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the
[Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables] section.

### Intended Usage

This transform is intended to be used as a protection mechanism to prevent
upstream mistakes. Such as a developer accidentally adding a `request_id`
tag. When this is happens, it is recommended to fix the upstream error as soon
as possible. This is because Vector's cardinality cache is held in memory and it
will be erased when Vector is restarted. This will cause new tag values to pass
through until the cardinality limit is reached again. For normal usage this
should not be a common problem since Vector processes are normally long-lived.

### Memory Utilization

This transform stores in memory a copy of the key for every tag on every metric
event seen by this transform.  In mode `exact`, a copy of every distinct
value *for each key* is also kept in memory, until [`value_limit`](#value_limit) distinct values
have been seen for a given key, at which point new values for that key will be
rejected.  So to estimate the memory usage of this transform in mode `exact`
you can use the following formula:

```text
(number of distinct field names in the tags for your metrics * average length of
the field names for the tags) + (number of distinct field names in the tags of
your metrics * [`value_limit`](#value_limit) * average length of the values of tags for your
metrics)
```

In mode `probabilistic`, rather than storing all values seen for each key, each
distinct key has a bloom filter which can probabilistically determine whether
a given value has been seen for that key.  The formula for estimating memory
usage in mode `probabilistic` is:

```text
(number of distinct field names in the tags for your metrics * average length of
the field names for the tags) + (number of distinct field names in the tags of
-your metrics * [`cache_size_per_tag`](#cache_size_per_tag))
```

The [`cache_size_per_tag`](#cache_size_per_tag) option controls the size of the bloom filter used
for storing the set of acceptable values for any single key. The larger the
bloom filter the lower the false positive rate, which in our case means the less
likely we are to allow a new tag value that would otherwise violate a
configured limit. If you want to know the exact false positive rate for a given
`cache_size_per_tag` and [`value_limit`](#value_limit), there are many free online bloom filter
calculators that can answer this. The formula is generally presented in terms of
'n', 'p', 'k', and 'm' where 'n' is the number of items in the filter
(`value_limit` in our case), 'p' is the probability of false positives (what we
want to solve for), 'k' is the number of hash functions used internally, and 'm'
is the number of bits in the bloom filter. You should be able to provide values
for just 'n' and 'm' and get back the value for 'p' with an optimal 'k' selected
for you.   Remember when converting from [`value_limit`](#value_limit) to the 'm' value to plug
into the calculator that [`value_limit`](#value_limit) is in bytes, and 'm' is often presented
in bits (1/8 of a byte).

### Restarts

This transform's cache is held in memory, and therefore, restarting Vector
will reset the cache. This means that new values will be passed through until
the cardinality limit is reached again. See [intended usage](#intended-usage)
for more info.
