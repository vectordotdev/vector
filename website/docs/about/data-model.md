## Event

All payloads passing through Vector are known as an "event", which is a
generalized type. In practice an event is either a [`log`](#log) or
[`metric`](#metric) at any given moment, depending on how it was consumed and
how it has been [transformed][docs.transforms] by Vector.

Whether a [transform][docs.transforms] or [sink][docs.sinks] can work with a
log, metric or both depends on the individual component and is made clear in
it's documentation.

## FAQ

### Why Not _Just_ Events?

People change, why can't event types?

We like the idea of unifying observability tools under a single event type a
lot, but we also want to play nice with existing tooling, which unfortunately
are currently at odds.

By starting simple (from an integration perspective) and evolving our data model
as we encounter the specific needs of new sources/sinks/transforms, we hope to
be both pragmatic and flexible as the industry evolves.
