	description: """
		Encrypts an IP address, transforming it into a different valid IP address.

		Supported Modes:

		* AES128 - Scrambles the entire IP address using AES-128 encryption. Can transform between IPv4 and IPv6.
		* PFX (Prefix-preserving) - Maintains network hierarchy by ensuring that IP addresses within the same network are encrypted to addresses that also share a common network. This preserves prefix relationships while providing confidentiality.

		"""
			The `aes128` mode implements the `ipcrypt-deterministic` algorithm from the IPCrypt specification, while the `pfx` mode implements the `ipcrypt-pfx` algorithm. Both modes provide deterministic encryption where the same input IP address encrypted with the same key will always produce the same encrypted output.
