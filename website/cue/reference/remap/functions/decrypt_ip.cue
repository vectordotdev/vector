	description: """
		Decrypts an IP address that was previously encrypted, restoring the original IP address.

		Supported Modes:

		* AES128 - Decrypts an IP address that was scrambled using AES-128 encryption. Can transform between IPv4 and IPv6.
		* PFX (Prefix-preserving) - Decrypts an IP address that was encrypted with prefix-preserving mode, where network hierarchy was maintained.

		"""
			The `aes128` mode implements the `ipcrypt-deterministic` algorithm from the IPCrypt specification, while the `pfx` mode implements the `ipcrypt-pfx` algorithm. This function reverses the encryption performed by `encrypt_ip` - the same key and algorithm that were used for encryption must be used for decryption.
