	description: """
		VRL enables you to transform [log events](\(urls.vector_log)) with very few restrictions but is much more
		restrictive when it comes to how you can transform [metrics](\(urls.vector_metric)). See the [event data
		model](\(urls.vector_remap_transform)#event-data-model) documentation for a field-by-field breakdown of changes
		you can and can't make to metric events.
