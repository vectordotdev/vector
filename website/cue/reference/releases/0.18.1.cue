	description: """
		The Vector team is pleased to announce version `v0.18.1`!

		This patch release contains a few bug fixes for regressions in `v0.18.0`.

		**Note:** Please see the release notes for [`v0.18.0`](/releases/0.18.0/) for additional changes if upgrading from
		`v0.17.X`. In particular, the upgrade guide for breaking changes.

		## Bug Fixes:

		- The new [automatic namespacing](/highlights/2021-11-18-implicit-namespacing/) feature broke usages of
		  `--config-dir` when directories were present that did not match Vector's config schema. Vector now just
		  ignores these directories and only looks at known namespacing directories like `sources/`.
		  [#10173](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/10173)
		  [#10177](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/10177).
		- The `elasticsearch` sink no longer logs a debug message for each event.
		  [#10117](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/10117).
		- The `remap` transform now only creates the `.dropped` output (as part of the new [failed event routing
		  feature](/highlights/2021-11-18-failed-event-routing/)) whenever `reroute_dropped = true`.
		  [#10152](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/10152)
		- A change to internal telemetry had caused aggregated histograms emitted by
		  the `prometheus_exporter` and `prometheus_remote_write` sinks to be
		  incorrectly tallied. This was fixed. [#10165](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/pull/10165)
