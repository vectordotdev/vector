				Vector can retrieve secrets like a password or token by querying an external system in order to

				sensitive token are configured in a dedicated section (`secret`). In the rest of the configuration you should use
				the `SECRET[<backend_name>.<secret_key>]` notation to interpolate the secret. Interpolation will happen immediately after
				environment variables interpolation. While Vector supports multiple commands to retrieve secrets, a
				secret backend cannot use the secret interpolation feature for its own configuration. Currently the only supported
				kind of secret backend is the `exec` one that runs an external command to retrieve secrets.

				The following example shows a simple configuration with two backends defined:

				```toml title="vector.yaml"
				secret:
					backend_1:
						type: "exec"
						command: ["/path/to/cmd1", "--some-option"]

			sub_sections: [
				{
					title: "The `exec` backend"
					body:  """
						When using the `exec` type for a secret backend Vector and the external command are communicating using
						the standard input and output. The communication is using plain text JSON. Vector spawns the specified
						command, writes the secret retrieval query using JSON on the standard input of the child process and
						reads its standard output expecting a JSON object. Standard error from the child process is read and
						logged by Vector and can be used for troubleshooting.

						The JSON object used for communication between an `exec` backend and Vector shall comply with the
						[Datadog Agent executable API](\(urls.datadog_agent_exec_api)).

						For example a query would look like:

						```json
						{
							"version": "1.0",
							"secrets": ["dd_api_key", "another_dd_api_key"]
						}
						```

						A possible reply from a backend could then be:

						```json
						{
							"dd_api_key": {"value": "A_DATADOG_API_KEY", "error": null},
							"another_dd_api_key": {"value": null, "error": "unable to retrieve secret"}
						}
						```

						If a backend writes a JSON that does not follow the expected structure or reports an error for a
						given secret Vector will refuse to load the configuration.

						Currently Vector will always query backend with `"version": "1.0"`.
