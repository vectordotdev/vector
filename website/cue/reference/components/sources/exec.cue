				When Vector begins shutting down (typically due to a SIGTERM), this source will
				signal to the child process to terminate, if it is running, to shut down.

				On *nix platforms, Vector will issue a SIGTERM to the child process, allowing it to
				gracefully shutdown, and the source will continue reading until the process exits or
				Vector's shutdown grace period expires. The duration of the grace period can be
				configured using `--graceful-shutdown-limit-secs`.

				On Windows, the subprocess will be issued a SIGKILL and terminate abruptly. In the
				future we hope to support graceful shutdown of Windows processes as well.
