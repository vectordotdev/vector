			title: "GCP Pub/Sub"
			body: """
				The `gcp_pubsub` source streams messages from [GCP Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub).
				This is a highly scalable / durable queueing system with at-least-once queuing semantics.
				Messages are received in a stream and are either acknowledged immediately after receiving
				or after it has been fully processed by the sink(s), depending on if any of the sink(s)
				have the `acknowledgements` setting enabled.
				"""
		}
		auto_concurrency: {
			title: "Automatic Concurrency Management"
			body: """
					The `gcp_pubsub` source automatically manages the number of concurrent active streams by
					monitoring the traffic flowing over the streams.
					When a stream receives full responses (as determined by the `full_response_size` setting),
					it marks itself as being "busy".
					Periodically, the source will poll all the active connections and will start a new stream
					if all the active streams are marked as busy and fewer than `max_concurrency` streams are
					active.
					Conversely, when a stream passes an idle interval (configured by the
					`idle_timeout_seconds` setting) with no traffic and no outstanding acknowledgements,
					it will drop the connection unless there are no other streams active.
					This combination of actions allows this source to respond dynamically to high load levels
					without opening up extra connections at startup.
