				An event can only be routed to a single output.
				The following is an example of how you can create two exclusive routes (plus the implicitly created `_unmatched` route).

				```yaml
				transforms:
					transform0:
						inputs:
							- source0
						type: exclusive_route
						routes:
							- name: "a"
								condition:
									type: vrl
									source: .level == 1
							- name: "b"
								condition:
									type: vrl
									# Note that the first condition is redundant. The previous route will always have precedence.
									source: .level == 1 || .level == 2

				tests:
					- name: case-1
						inputs:
							- type: log
								insert_at: transform0
								log_fields:
									level: 1
							- type: log
								insert_at: transform0
								log_fields:
									level: 2
						outputs:
							- extract_from: transform0.a
								conditions:
									- type: vrl
										source: |
