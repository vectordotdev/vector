				For clarification, when you convert a single `log` event into multiple `metric`

				It's important to understand that this transform does not reduce multiple logs

				happens depends on your metrics storage. For example, the
				[`prometheus_exporter` sink](\(urls.vector_sinks)/prometheus_exporter) will reduce logs in the sink itself
				for the next scrape, while other metrics sinks will proceed to forward the
				individual metrics for reduction in the metrics storage itself.
