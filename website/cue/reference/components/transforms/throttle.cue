			title: "Rate Limiting"

				The `throttle` transform will spread load across the configured `window_secs`, ensuring that each bucket's
				throughput averages out to the `threshold` per `window_secs`. It utilizes a [Generic Cell Rate Algorithm](\(urls.gcra)) to
				rate limit the event stream.

						The `throttle` transform buckets events into rate limiters based on the provided `key_field`, or a
						single bucket if not provided. Each bucket is rate limited separately.
						"""
				},
				{
					title: "Quotas"
					body: """
						Rate limiters use "cells" to determine if there is sufficient capacity for an event to successfully
						pass through a rate limiter. Each event passing through the transform consumes an available cell,
						if there is no available cell the event will be rate limited.

						A rate limiter is created with a maximum number of cells equal to the `threshold`, and cells replenish
						at a rate of `window_secs` divided by `threshold`. For example, a `window_secs` of 60 with a `threshold` of 10
						replenishes a cell every 6 seconds and allows a burst of up to 10 events.
						"""

				{
					title: "Rate Limited Events"
					body: """
						The rate limiter will allow up to `threshold` number of events through and drop any further events
						for that particular bucket when the rate limiter is at capacity. Any event passed when the rate
						limiter is at capacity will be discarded and tracked by an `events_discarded_total` metric tagged
						by the bucket's `key`.
