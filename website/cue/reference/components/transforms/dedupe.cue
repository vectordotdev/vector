				will be removed from the cache in the order they were inserted. If
				an Event is received that is considered a duplicate of an Event
				already in the cache that will put that event back to the head of

				Each entry in the cache corresponds to an incoming Event and

				be the list of fields specified in that configuration option. When
				using `fields.ignore` that will include all fields present in the
				incoming event except those specified in `fields.ignore`. Each entry
				also uses a single byte per field to store the type information of

				```text
				Sum(the average size of the *data* (but not including the field name) for each field in `fields.match`) * `cache.num_events`
				```

				When using `fields.ignore`:
