			Reroutes unmatched events to a named output instead of silently discarding them.

			Normally, if an event doesn't match any defined route, it is sent to the `<transform_name>._unmatched`
			output for further processing. In some cases, you may want to simply discard unmatched events and not
			process them any further.

			In these cases, `reroute_unmatched` can be set to `false` to disable the `<transform_name>._unmatched`
			output and instead silently discard any unmatched events.

			A map from route identifiers to logical conditions.
			Each condition represents a filter which is applied to each event.

			The following identifiers are reserved output names and thus cannot be used as route IDs:
			- `_unmatched`
			- `_default`

			Each route can then be referenced as an input by other components with the name
			`<transform_name>.<route_id>`. If an event doesnâ€™t match any route, and if `reroute_unmatched`
			is set to `true` (the default), it is sent to the `<transform_name>._unmatched` output.
			Otherwise, the unmatched event is instead silently discarded.
