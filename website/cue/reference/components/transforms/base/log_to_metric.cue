			This is an example JSON representation of a counter with the following properties:

			- `counter`: An object with a single property `value` representing the counter value, in this case, `10.0`).
			- `kind`: A string indicating the kind of counter, in this case, "incremental".
			- `name`: A string representing the name of the counter, here set to "test.transform.counter".
			- `tags`: An object containing additional tags such as "env" and "host".

			Objects that can be processed include counter, histogram, gauge, set and summary.

					Metric kind.

					Metrics can be either absolute or incremental. Absolute metrics represent a sort of "last write wins" scenario,
					where the latest absolute value seen is meant to be the actual metric value.  In contrast, and perhaps intuitively,
					incremental metrics are meant to be additive, such that we don't know what total value of the metric is, but we know
					that we'll be adding or subtracting the given value from it.

					Generally speaking, most metrics storage systems deal with incremental updates. A notable exception is Prometheus,
					which deals with, and expects, absolute values from clients.
