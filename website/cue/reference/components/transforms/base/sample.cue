			of sampling may differ from the configured one if values in the field are not uniformly
			distributed. If left unspecified, or if the event doesnâ€™t have `key_field`, then the
			event is sampled independently.

			This can be useful to, for example, ensure that all logs for a given transaction are
			sampled together, but that overall `1/N` transactions are sampled.
