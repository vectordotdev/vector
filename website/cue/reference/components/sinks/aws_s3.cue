		object_acl: {

				AWS S3 supports [access control lists (ACL)](\(urls.aws_s3_acl)) for buckets and
				objects. In the context of Vector, only object ACLs are relevant (Vector does
				not create or modify buckets). You can set the object level ACL by using one
				of the `acl`, `grant_full_control`, `grant_read`, `grant_read_acp`, or
				`grant_write_acp` options.

		object_naming: {
			title: "Object naming"
			body:  """
				Vector uses two different naming schemes for S3 objects. If you set the
				[`compression`](#compression) parameter to `true` (this is the default), Vector uses
				this scheme:

				```text
				<key_prefix><timestamp>-<uuidv4>.log.gz
				```

				If compression isn't enabled, Vector uses this scheme (only the file extension
				is different):

				```text
				<key_prefix><timestamp>-<uuidv4>.log
				```

				Some sample S3 object names (with and without compression, respectively):

				```text
				date=2019-06-18/1560886634-fddd7a0e-fad9-4f7e-9bce-00ae5debc563.log.gz
				date=2019-06-18/1560886634-fddd7a0e-fad9-4f7e-9bce-00ae5debc563.log
				```

				Vector appends a [UUIDV4](\(urls.uuidv4)) token to ensure there are no naming
				conflicts in the unlikely event that two Vector instances are writing data at the
				same time.

				You can control the resulting name via the [`key_prefix`](#key_prefix),
				[`filename_time_format`](#filename_time_format), and
				[`filename_append_uuid`](#filename_append_uuid) options.

				For example, to store objects at the root S3 folder, without a timestamp or UUID use
				these configuration options:

				```text
				key_prefix = "{{ my_file_name }}"
				filename_time_format = ""
				filename_append_uuid = false
				```

				_not_ support [object metadata](\(urls.aws_s3_metadata)). If you require metadata
				support see [issue #1694](\(urls.issue_1694)).

				We believe tags are more flexible since they are separate from the actual S3
				object. You can freely modify tags without modifying the object. Conversely,
				object metadata requires a full rewrite of the object to make changes.

				possible. You can explicitly set the object level encryption via the
				`server_side_encryption` option.
