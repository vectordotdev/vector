# Changelog
#
# - Works for both fork‑based PRs (pull_request) and same‑repo PRs (pull_request_target)
# Runs on PRs when:
#   - opened/re-opened
#   - new commits pushed
#   - label is added or removed
# Runs on merge queues, but just passes, because it is a required check.

  # run even before the workflow file change is merged, which prevents the “Changelog Expected”
  # status from getting stuck on the current PR.

  # Trigger again in the base‑repo context so that future PRs from forks have access to
