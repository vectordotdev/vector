      In order to properly evaluate a feature request, it is necessary to
      understand the use-cases for it.

      Please describe below the _end goal_ you are trying to achieve that has
      led you to request this feature.

      Please keep this section focused on the problem and not on the suggested
      solution. We'll get to that in a moment, below!

      If you've already tried to solve the problem within Vector's existing
      features and found a limitation that prevented you from succeeding, please
      describe it below in as much detail as possible.

      Ideally, this would include real configuration snippets that you tried
      and what results you got in each case.

      Please remove any sensitive information such as passwords before sharing
      configuration snippets and command lines.

      If you have an idea for a way to address the problem via a change to
      Vector features, please describe it below.

      In this section, it's helpful to include specific examples of how what
      you are suggesting might look in configuration files, or on the command line,
      since that allows us to understand the full picture of what you are proposing.

      If you're not sure of some details, don't worry! When we evaluate the
      feature request we may suggest modifications as necessary to work within the
      design constraints of Vector.
