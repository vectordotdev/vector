### Use-cases

### Attempted Solutions

<!---
If you've already tried to solve the problem within Vector's existing features and found a limitation that prevented you from succeeding, please describe it below in as much detail as possible.

Ideally, this would include real configuration snippets that you tried and what results you got in each case.

### Proposal

<!---
If you have an idea for a way to address the problem via a change to Vector features, please describe it below.

In this section, it's helpful to include specific examples of how what you are suggesting might look in configuration files, or on the command line, since that allows us to understand the full picture of what you are proposing.

If you're not sure of some details, don't worry! When we evaluate the feature request we may suggest modifications as necessary to work within the design constraints of Vector.
